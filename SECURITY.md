## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ICN Core team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please email the lead maintainers at [security@intercooperative.network](mailto:security@intercooperative.network).

Please include the following details with your report:

*   A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Any (anonymized) proof-of-concept or exploit code.
*   Information about the affected versions.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

## Disclosure Policy

When the team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions.
2.  **Audit code** to find any similar problems.
3.  **Prepare fixes** for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be applied to the main branch and any necessary release branches.
4.  **Release new versions** with the fix.
5.  Once the fix is publicly available, **publicly disclose the vulnerability** through a security advisory on GitHub and potentially other channels if deemed necessary.

We aim to handle disclosures responsibly and will coordinate with you on the timing of public announcements.

We appreciate your help in keeping ICN Core secure.
