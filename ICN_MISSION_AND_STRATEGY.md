# ICN Mission and Strategic Direction

This document summarizes the InterCooperative Network's mission, guiding principles, and high-level project goals.

## Mission and Guiding Principles

ICN aims to **replace every major function of the state and corporation with programmable, federated, democratic infrastructure** built for real human needs and scalable solidarity. Key principles include:

- **Anti-Capitalist Design** – decisions prioritize collective benefit over extraction
- **Nonviolent Infrastructure** – cooperative coordination replaces systemic violence
- **Revolutionary Pluralism** – local autonomy coexists within networked solidarity
- **Memetic Security** – resistance to capture using humorous, viral tactics
- **Regenerative Systems** – ecological and social regeneration patterns
- **Dignity & Autonomy** – technology enhances human agency rather than controlling it

## Project Goals and Strategic Direction

The project delivers a production-ready cooperative infrastructure engine with a long-term vision of:

- **Systemic Sovereignty** – autonomous systems independent of state control
- **Post-Capitalist Coordination** – economic organization beyond markets
- **Consciousness Architecture** – programmable collective decision-making
- **Collective Liberation** – universal human flourishing through shared infrastructure

Current efforts focus on Phase 5 of the roadmap, aiming for production readiness through real networking, persistent storage, robust governance, and comprehensive monitoring. Upcoming phases will expand advanced governance features, interoperability, mobile applications, and systemic transformation tools.
