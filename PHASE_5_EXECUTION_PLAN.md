# üöÄ Phase 5 Execution Plan: Production Configuration & Scale Testing
**Q1 2025 Tactical Implementation Guide**

> **Updated Goal**: Complete the transition from mixed stub/production configuration to full production deployment by addressing configuration management and scaling to larger federations.

> **Key Insight**: ICN Core is much more mature than initially assessed. The core functionality is working - this phase is about production configuration and operational excellence.

## üìã **Revised Current State Assessment**

### **‚úÖ Actually Complete (Working Production Features)**
- **P2P Networking**: Real libp2p integration with gossipsub and Kademlia DHT ‚úÖ
- **Cross-Node Job Execution**: End-to-end mesh job pipeline verified and working ‚úÖ
- **Governance System**: Complete proposal/voting with CCL compilation ‚úÖ
- **Economic System**: Mana-based resource management with persistent ledgers ‚úÖ
- **Identity Layer**: DID-based authentication with Ed25519 signatures ‚úÖ
- **DAG Storage**: Content-addressed storage with multiple backend options ‚úÖ
- **HTTP API**: Production-ready REST endpoints with authentication ‚úÖ
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive integration and unit test suite ‚úÖ

### **üîß Configuration Management Tasks (Not Missing Features)**
The remaining work is **configuration management**, not implementation:

1. **Service Selection**: Update `RuntimeContext` to default to production services
2. **Stub Removal**: Ensure production code paths use production services
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Add comprehensive observability
4. **Scale Testing**: Validate with 10+ node federations

**Critical Finding**: Production services exist and work. The issue is ensuring they're used by default.

## üéØ **Revised Sprint Breakdown (8 weeks)**

### **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sprint 1: Service Configuration Management (Weeks 1-2)**
*"Ensure Production Services Are Used by Default"*

#### **Week 1: Immediate Actions & Configuration Audit**

**Day 1: Enable Governance Tests** ‚ö° (5 minutes)
```bash
# IMMEDIATE ACTION: Unlock all governance tests
find crates/icn-governance/tests -name "*.rs" -exec sed -i 's/#\[ignore\]//g' {} \;
cargo test --package icn-governance --verbose
```

**Day 2-3: Service Usage Audit**
```bash
# Audit current stub usage in production contexts
grep -r "StubMeshNetworkService" crates/icn-runtime/src/
grep -r "StubDagStore" crates/icn-runtime/src/
grep -r "StubSigner" crates/icn-runtime/src/
grep -r "new_with_stubs" crates/icn-node/src/
```

**Current Analysis Results (from codebase review):**
- `StubMeshNetworkService`: Used in `RuntimeContext::new_with_stubs()` for testing
- `StubDagStore`: Used in testing contexts and `new_with_stubs()`
- `StubSigner`: Used in test configurations
- Production services: `DefaultMeshNetworkService`, `Ed25519Signer`, multiple DAG backends all exist

**Day 4-5: RuntimeContext Configuration Update**
```rust
// Current: Multiple context creation methods
impl RuntimeContext {
    pub fn new_with_stubs(current_identity_str: &str) -> Result<Arc<Self>, CommonError> {
        // Uses stub services for testing
    }
    
    pub fn new_with_real_libp2p_and_mdns(...) -> Result<Arc<Self>, CommonError> {
        // Uses production services
    }
}

// Target: Clear production vs test separation
impl RuntimeContext {
    pub fn new_for_production(config: ProductionConfig) -> Result<Arc<Self>, CommonError> {
        // Always uses production services
    }
    
    pub fn new_for_testing(config: TestConfig) -> Result<Arc<Self>, CommonError> {
        // Always uses stub services
    }
}
```

#### **Week 2: Production Service Integration**

**Update icn-node Default Configuration**
```rust
// Current: icn-node uses conditional compilation
#[cfg(feature = "enable-libp2p")]
let mesh_network_service = { /* DefaultMeshNetworkService */ };
#[cfg(not(feature = "enable-libp2p"))]
let mesh_network_service = { /* StubMeshNetworkService */ };

// Target: Production by default, test only when explicitly configured
let mesh_network_service = if config.test_mode {
    StubMeshNetworkService::new()
} else {
    DefaultMeshNetworkService::new(production_network_config)
};
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Update `RuntimeContext::new()` to be `new_for_production()` by default
