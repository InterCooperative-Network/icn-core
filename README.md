# ICN Core v0.2 ‚Äì Cooperative Infrastructure Engine

> **Building the infrastructure for a cooperative digital economy**

ICN Core is the reference implementation of the InterCooperative Network (ICN) protocol, written in Rust. It provides production-ready infrastructure for federations, cooperatives, and communities to coordinate democratically without relying on traditional centralized systems.

**Mission**: Replace every major function of the state and corporation with programmable, federated, democratic infrastructure‚Äîbuilt for actual human needs and scalable solidarity.

## üéØ What ICN Provides

### **Production-Ready Platform** (77% Complete)
‚úÖ **Multi-node P2P federation** with automatic peer discovery  
‚úÖ **Cross-node job execution** with cryptographic verification  
‚úÖ **Democratic governance** with programmable policies  
‚úÖ **Economic coordination** with mana-based resource management  
‚úÖ **Federated identity** with DID-based authentication  
‚úÖ **HTTP API** with comprehensive REST endpoints  

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Shared Computing**: Mesh job execution across federation members
- **Democratic Governance**: Proposal creation, voting, and policy enforcement via CCL
- **Economic Enforcement**: Mana-based resource allocation preventing abuse
- **Federated Identity**: DID-based membership with cryptographic verification
- **Persistent History**: Content-addressed DAG storage for transparency
- **Developer Tools**: CLI, API, containerized testing environment

### **Cooperative Features**
ICN is specifically designed for cooperative organizations:
- **Programmable Bylaws**: Encode governance as executable CCL contracts
- **Member Management**: Democratic invitation, voting, and role assignment
- **Resource Sharing**: Pool computing, storage, and economic resources
- **Transparent Decisions**: All governance actions cryptographically recorded
- **Anti-Extraction**: Regenerating mana economy prevents speculation

### **Identity & Security**
- **`icn-identity`** ‚Äì DID management, credential verification, and cryptographic operations
- **`icn-dag`** ‚Äì Content-addressed storage with multiple backend options

### **Governance & Economics**
- **`icn-governance`** ‚Äì Proposal engine, voting mechanisms, and policy execution
- **`icn-economics`** ‚Äì Mana accounting and economic policy enforcement
- **`icn-reputation`** ‚Äì Trust scoring and contribution tracking

### **Networking & Computation**
- **`icn-network`** ‚Äì P2P networking with libp2p integration
- **`icn-mesh`** ‚Äì Distributed job scheduling and execution

### **Language & Tools**
- **`icn-ccl`** ‚Äì Cooperative Contract Language compiler
