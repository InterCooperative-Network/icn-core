# ICN Core v0.2 ‚Äì Advanced Cooperative Infrastructure Development

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT STATUS: This project has substantial working implementations but is NOT production ready**

ICN Core is the **advanced development** reference implementation of the InterCooperative Network (ICN) protocol, written in Rust with comprehensive frontend applications. It provides **working cooperative infrastructure** for federations, cooperatives, and communities with substantial functionality, but requires security review and production hardening.

**Mission**: Replace every major function of the state and corporation with programmable, federated, democratic infrastructure‚Äîbuilt for actual human needs and scalable solidarity.

**Current Status**: This is **advanced development software** with substantial working implementations. While it demonstrates **real P2P networking, cross-node job execution, governance/economic systems, and end-to-end workflows**, it should **NOT be used in production environments** without security review.

## üöß Development Status Warning

**IMPORTANT**: ICN Core has substantial working functionality but critical production readiness gaps:

- **Security Review Needed**: Cryptographic implementations require professional security audit
- **Production Hardening**: Monitoring, error recovery, and operational procedures need development
- **Scale Testing**: Works in development, needs validation at production scale  
- **API Stability**: APIs and data formats may change during development
- **Operational Excellence**: Production deployment procedures incomplete

**Use for:**
- Development and testing of cooperative infrastructure
- Research and experimentation with federated governance
- Contributing to the development of cooperative digital infrastructure
- Learning about distributed systems and cooperative technology

**DO NOT use for:**
- Production applications without security review
- Real economic transactions without audit
- Critical governance decisions without testing
- Any system where data loss or security issues would cause harm

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Service Architecture
ICN uses trait-based service abstractions with multiple backend implementations:
```rust
// Multiple storage backends
pub trait DagStore: Send + Sync {
    async fn store_block(&self, block: DagBlock) -> Result<Cid, DagError>;
    async fn get_block(&self, cid: &Cid) -> Result<Option<DagBlock>, DagError>;
}

// Implementations: PostgreSQL, RocksDB, SQLite, Sled, Memory
```

### Configuration-Driven Services
```rust
// Production vs development service selection
let mesh_service = match config.environment {
    Environment::Production => DefaultMeshNetworkService::new(libp2p_service),
    Environment::Development => DefaultMeshNetworkService::new_development(),
    Environment::Testing => StubMeshNetworkService::new(),
};
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum RuntimeError {
    #[error("Insufficient mana: required {required}, available {available}")]
    InsufficientMana { required: u64, available: u64 },
    
    #[error("Job execution failed: {job_id} - {reason}")]
    JobExecutionFailed { job_id: JobId, reason: String },
}
```
