# ICN Core

`icn-core` is the reference implementation of the InterCooperative Network (ICN) protocol, written in Rust.
It provides the foundational crates for building ICN nodes, CLI tools, and other related infrastructure.

**ICN Mission**: Replace every major function of the state and corporation with programmable, federated, democratic infrastructureâ€”built for actual human needs and scalable solidarity.

For full architecture, philosophy, and comprehensive feature overview, see:
- [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) - Core philosophy and architectural principles
- [docs/ICN_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md](docs/ICN_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md) - Complete feature set (current and planned)

## Overview

The InterCooperative Network is a comprehensive platform for building federated, cooperative digital infrastructure. This repository contains the core building blocks for autonomous federated systems that enable cooperative coordination without relying on traditional state or corporate structures.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **100% Rust**: Memory-safe, performant foundation
- **Cooperative Virtual Machine (CoVM)**: WASM-first deterministic execution
- **DAG Ledger**: Content-addressed storage without blockchain complexity  
- **Scoped Identity**: DIDs with built-in federation support
- **Anti-Capitalist Economics**: Purpose-bound tokens that cannot be speculated on
- **Governance as Code**: Programmable bylaws via Cooperative Contract Language (CCL)

### Rust Toolchain

This repository is pinned to the nightly Rust toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml`.
Install it with:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup override set nightly
```

## Getting Started

Refer to `docs/ONBOARDING.md` for detailed instructions on prerequisites, setup, building, testing, and running the components. The latest API documentation is available at [https://intercooperative.network/docs](https://intercooperative.network/docs).

### Quick CLI Examples:

```bash
# Build with libp2p support and the default `sled` persistence backend
cargo build --features with-libp2p

# Build using the SQLite backend
cargo build --no-default-features --features "with-libp2p persist-sqlite"

# Build using the RocksDB backend
cargo build --no-default-features --features "with-libp2p persist-rocksdb"

# Start a node with persistent storage, P2P, and TLS enabled
./target/debug/icn-node \
  --enable-p2p \
  --p2p-listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001 \
  --storage-backend sqlite \
  --storage-path ./icn_data/node1.sqlite \
  --mana-ledger-backend sled \
  --mana-ledger-path ./icn_data/mana1.sled \
  --auth-token "secure-api-token" \
  --tls-cert-path ./certs/server.crt \
  --tls-key-path ./certs/server.key

# In a second terminal start another node connecting to the first
./target/debug/icn-node \
  --enable-p2p \
  --p2p-listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4002 \
  --bootstrap-peers /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/<PEER_ID> \
  --storage-backend sqlite \
  --storage-path ./icn_data/node2.sqlite \
  --mana-ledger-backend sled \
  --mana-ledger-path ./icn_data/mana2.sled

# Interact with a node via the CLI
./target/debug/icn-cli info
./target/debug/icn-cli status
./target/debug/icn-cli governance propose "Increase mesh job timeout to 300 seconds"
./target/debug/icn-cli mesh submit-job echo-job.json

# Federation management commands
./target/debug/icn-cli federation join <PEER_ID>
./target/debug/icn-cli federation status
./target/debug/icn-cli federation leave <PEER_ID>
./target/debug/icn-cli federation list-peers
```

### Justfile Commands

Common development tasks are defined in a `justfile` at the repository root. Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and run:

```bash
just format   # check formatting
just lint     # run clippy
just test     # execute all tests
just build    # build all crates
just devnet   # launch the containerized federation devnet
icn-devnet/launch_federation.sh # build and test the federation containers
```

Before running `just format` or `cargo fmt`, make sure the `rustfmt` component is installed:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt
```

### Enabling Peer Discovery and Persistent Storage

1. **Compile with libp2p support** using `cargo build --features with-libp2p`.
2. Start each node with `--enable-p2p` and a unique `--p2p-listen-addr`.
3. Provide known peers via `--bootstrap-peers` to join an existing mesh.
4. Use `--storage-backend sqlite|sled|rocksdb|file` with a dedicated `--storage-path` to persist DAG blocks and governance state across restarts.
5. Configure `--mana-ledger-backend sled|sqlite|rocksdb|file` with `--mana-ledger-path` for persistent mana accounting.
6. Optional: Enable API security with `--auth-token` and TLS with `--tls-cert-path` and `--tls-key-path`.

For multi-node testing instructions, see [Libp2p Integration Tests](MULTI_NODE_GUIDE.md#libp2p-integration-tests).

### Metrics & Observability

ICN crates expose Prometheus metrics using the `prometheus-client` crate. When
running `icn-node` with the embedded HTTP server enabled, scrape metrics at the
`/metrics` endpoint. Counters such as `host_submit_mesh_job_calls` and gauges for
network latency are collected automatically.

## ICN Philosophy & Design Principles

### **Core Values**
- **Anti-Capitalist Design**: Every choice prioritizes collective benefit over extraction
- **Nonviolent Infrastructure**: Replace systemic violence with cooperative coordination
- **Revolutionary Pluralism**: Enable local autonomy within networked solidarity
- **Dignity & Autonomy**: Technology that enhances human agency

### **Technical Principles**
- **Deterministic Execution**: All core logic is predictable and verifiable
- **Purpose-Bound Economics**: Tokens scoped to specific capabilities, no speculation
- **Governance as Code**: Bylaws and policies encoded in CCL and executed automatically
- **Federated Autonomy**: Local control with voluntary federation protocols

### **Strategic Vision**
- **Systemic Sovereignty**: Autonomous systems independent of state control
- **Post-Capitalist Coordination**: Tools for economic organization beyond markets
- **Consciousness Architecture**: Programmable collective decision-making
- **Collective Liberation**: Infrastructure for universal human flourishing

## Error Handling Philosophy

This project prioritizes robust and clear error handling to improve developer experience and system reliability:

1. **No Panics in Libraries**: Library crates avoid `panic!` for recoverable errors, returning `Result<T, CommonError>` instead.
2. **Specific Error Variants**: The `icn_common::CommonError` enum defines comprehensive error types with contextual information.
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Error variants include detailed context for debugging and user feedback.
4. **Graceful Handling in Binaries**: Executables catch errors, provide user-friendly messages, and exit with appropriate status codes.
5. **Error Propagation**: Errors are propagated up the call stack with additional context at each layer.

This approach ensures errors are not silently ignored and provides clear debugging information for developers.
