# Contributing to the InterCooperative Network (ICN)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the ICN! It's people like you that make the ICN such a great community.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the ICN itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "feature request" label. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it's needed, and how it would work. You can use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEAT%5D).

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to ICN? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment (`icn-devnet`)

[TODO: Add instructions for setting up the `icn-devnet` environment. Include any prerequisites, tools to install (Rust, Docker, etc.), and steps to get a local development instance running.]

### Running Tests and Linters

[TODO: Add instructions on how to run tests and linters. Specify the commands for `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`, etc. Mention any specific configurations or environments needed for testing.]

### How to Claim an Issue

If you see an issue you'd like to work on, please comment on the issue expressing your interest. This helps avoid duplicated effort. If the issue is already assigned or someone has already expressed interest, consider looking for another issue or offering to collaborate.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The Githu Maintainers will have the final say on versioning.
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
