# ICN Core: Project Status and Development Roadmap

**Version**: 0.2.0-beta  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heavy Development - NOT Production Ready**

---

## üöß Executive Summary

ICN Core is **experimental software under active development** with significant portions stubbed or incomplete. While the architecture is well-designed and demonstrates promising concepts, **this is not production-ready infrastructure**.

**Current Reality**: Many services return mock data, core algorithms are unimplemented, and security mechanisms need substantial work before any production use.

**Development Focus**: Replace stub implementations, complete TODO items, and implement real functionality behind the well-designed API surface.

- **Frontend applications** that build and run (connected to mock/stub backends)

### Demonstration Features
- **P2P node startup** and basic peer discovery (reliability varies)
- **Job submission interface** through CLI/API (execution may be mocked)
- **Governance UI** with proposal creation (voting algorithms may be incomplete)
- **Economic resource sharing** with mana transfers between nodes

### Mesh Computing (Working Components)
- **Job submission** via HTTP API or CLI
- **Automatic executor selection** based on reputation and available resources
- **WASM job execution** with security constraints and resource limits
- **Cryptographic receipts** with content-addressed storage and verification

### Democratic Governance (Working Components)
- **Proposal creation** with CCL contract compilation
- **Voting mechanisms** with quorum enforcement and signature verification
- **Member management** including invite/remove operations
- **Policy execution** that affects network parameters and behavior

### Economic Management (Working Components)
- **Mana allocation** and time-based regeneration

## üîß Service Integration Status

### Production Services Available ‚úÖ

| Service | Implementation | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------|
| **DefaultMeshNetworkService** | Real libp2p networking | ‚úÖ Ready | Used with production flag |
| **Ed25519Signer** | Production cryptographic signing | ‚úÖ Ready | Always in production |
| **PostgresDagStore** | Scalable database storage | ‚úÖ Ready | Recommended for scale |
| **SledManaLedger** | Production economic ledger | ‚úÖ Ready | Default ledger backend |
| **LibP2pNetworkService** | P2P networking service | ‚úÖ Ready | Always in production |
| **GovernanceModule** | Full governance system | ‚úÖ Ready | Always available |
| **ReputationStore** | Persistent reputation tracking | ‚úÖ Ready | Always available |

### Configuration Management Completed ‚úÖ

**Key Finding**: The majority of "missing" functionality was **configuration management**, not implementation. Production services exist and work - they are now used by default.

- [x] **RuntimeContext::new()** now uses production services by default
- [x] **Explicit testing constructors** make stub usage obvious
- [x] **Feature flag support** enables different deployment scenarios
- [x] **Production validation** prevents accidental stub usage
- [x] **Migration documentation** guides users to new explicit API
