# ICN Core: Project Status and Development Roadmap

**Version**: 0.2.0-beta  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced Development - NOT Production Ready**

---

## üöß Executive Summary

ICN Core is **advanced development software** with substantial working implementations across core domains. While **not production-ready**, it has significantly more functional code than typical early-stage projects and represents a sophisticated cooperative infrastructure platform.

**Current Reality**: Most core features have working implementations, but require security review, production hardening, and operational excellence improvements before production deployment.

**Development Focus**: Security hardening, production readiness, scale testing, and operational excellence rather than building missing core functionality.
