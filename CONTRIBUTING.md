Thank you for your interest in contributing to the InterCooperative Network (ICN) Core project! We welcome contributions from everyone.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. Please read it carefully to ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub to manage issues and feature requests, as well as to accept contributions via pull requests.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/USERNAME/icn-core/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate efforts and ensure that the proposed enhancement aligns with the project's goals.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`cargo test --all`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (`cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings`).
6.  Issue that pull request!
