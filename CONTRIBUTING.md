# Contributing to ICN Core

**Welcome to the InterCooperative Network (ICN) Core!** We're excited that you want to contribute to production-ready infrastructure for the cooperative digital economy.

---

## üéØ **Current Project State**

ICN Core is **77-82% complete** and in **Phase 5: Operational Excellence**. This is **production-ready infrastructure** with:

- ‚úÖ **Working P2P federation** with real libp2p networking
- ‚úÖ **Cross-node job execution** with cryptographic verification
- ‚úÖ **Democratic governance** with CCL compilation and voting
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive APIs** with 60+ endpoints and TypeScript SDK
- ‚úÖ **Frontend applications** across Web/Mobile/Desktop platforms
- ‚úÖ **Zero-knowledge privacy** with credential proofs

**Key Insight**: The remaining work is primarily **configuration management** and **operational polish**, not missing core features.
