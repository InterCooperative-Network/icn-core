# Contributing to ICN Core

**Welcome to the InterCooperative Network (ICN) Core!** We're excited that you want to contribute to **experimental infrastructure** for the cooperative digital economy.

---

## üöß **Current Project State**

ICN Core is **under heavy development** with **many stub implementations and incomplete features**. This is **experimental software** with:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **P2P networking demonstrations** (some features stubbed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Job execution prototypes** (security and reliability need work)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Governance foundations** (voting mechanisms partially implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API scaffolding** (many endpoints return mock data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend applications** (connected to stub backends)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cryptographic frameworks** (implementations may be incomplete)

**Key Focus**: The primary work involves **replacing stub implementations with real functionality** and **completing TODO items** throughout the codebase.

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **1. Get Up and Running (10 Minutes)**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/InterCooperative/icn-core
cd icn-core
just setup-all         # Backend + Frontend environment

# Verify what currently works (expect some failures)
just validate-all-stack # Validation may show stub implementations
just devnet            # Start 3-node federation (may have limitations)
```

### **2. Choose Your Area**
- **Backend (Rust)**: Replace stub implementations, complete TODO items, fix failing tests
- **Frontend (React/React Native)**: Connect to real backends, replace mock data
- **Security**: Implement proper cryptographic operations, harden key management  
- **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect actual implementation status
- **Testing**: Add tests for new implementations, improve coverage
