# Contributing to ICN Core

**Welcome to the InterCooperative Network (ICN) Core!** We're excited that you want to contribute to **experimental infrastructure** for the cooperative digital economy.

---

## üöß **Current Project State**

ICN Core is **advanced development software** with **substantial working implementations** across core domains. While **NOT production-ready**, it has significantly more functional code than typical early-stage projects. This is **experimental cooperative infrastructure** with:

- ‚úÖ **CCL WASM Compilation**: Full pipeline from CCL source to WASM execution
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Backend Storage**: PostgreSQL, RocksDB, SQLite, Sled all operational  
- ‚úÖ **P2P Networking**: libp2p with gossipsub and Kademlia DHT working
- ‚úÖ **Governance Workflows**: Proposals, ranked choice voting, budget allocation functional
- ‚úÖ **Economic Systems**: Mana ledgers, resource tokens, mutual credit working
- ‚úÖ **Mesh Computing**: End-to-end job submission, bidding, execution, receipt generation
- ‚úÖ **Identity Management**: DID creation, credential verification, signing operational
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Review**: Cryptographic implementations need production-level audit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scale Testing**: Works in development, needs validation at production scale

**Key Focus**: The primary work involves **security hardening, production readiness, and operational excellence** rather than building missing core functionality.
