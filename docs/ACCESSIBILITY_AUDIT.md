## Screen Reader Testing

### Recommended Testing Tools
- **NVDA** (Windows) - Free, widely used
- **JAWS** (Windows) - Industry standard
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS) - Built-in Apple solution
- **TalkBack** (Android) - Built-in Android solution
- **ORCA** (Linux) - Open source option

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Error messages are announced
- [ ] Status changes are announced
- [ ] Dynamic content updates are communicated
- [ ] Modal dialogs work correctly
- [ ] Language switching is announced

## Mobile Accessibility

### React Native Considerations
- [x] accessibilityLabel for all interactive elements
- [x] accessibilityHint where needed
- [x] accessibilityRole specified
- [ ] **Needs testing**: Voice control (iOS/Android)
- [ ] **Needs testing**: Switch control compatibility

### Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] iOS VoiceOver testing
- [ ] Android TalkBack testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation on web view
- [ ] Focus management across platforms

## Internationalization Accessibility

### Language Support
- [x] English (en) - 100% complete
- [x] Spanish (es) - 100% complete  
- [x] French (fr) - 100% complete
- [ ] **Planned**: Arabic (ar) - RTL support needed
- [ ] **Planned**: Chinese (zh) - Character encoding considerations
- [ ] **Planned**: German (de) - Compound word considerations

### RTL Language Preparation
```css
/* RTL styles ready for Arabic/Hebrew */
[dir="rtl"] {
  text-align: right;
}

[dir="rtl"] .flex-row {
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}

[dir="rtl"] .margin-left {
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: var(--spacing);
}
```

### Cultural Considerations

### Automated Testing Tools
```bash
# Install accessibility testing tools
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react
npm install --save-dev jest-axe
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

### Accessibility Test Integration
```javascript
// Example Jest test with jest-axe
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import { Component } from './Component'

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

test('should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Component />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```
