# Implementation Guide: New Documentation and Communication Process

This guide helps maintainers implement the new documentation and communication process established to address issues #941, #942, and #944.

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Set Up Communication Calendar
- [ ] **Add monthly status update dates** to maintainer calendars (first Monday of each month)
- [ ] **Add quarterly roadmap review dates** (first week of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct)
- [ ] **Create GitHub Discussion template** for monthly updates
- [ ] **Announce new process** to community via GitHub Discussions

### 2. RFC Process Launch
- [ ] **Review the three initial RFCs** (governance, core vs CCL, tokenomics)
- [ ] **Create GitHub issues** for each RFC to gather community feedback
- [ ] **Announce RFC process** to community and invite participation
- [ ] **Schedule maintainer RFC review meetings**

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update README.md** if needed to reflect new communication process
- [ ] **Add RFC links** to relevant existing documentation
- [ ] **Review CONTRIBUTING.md changes** and ensure accuracy

## First Month Implementation

### Monthly Status Update (Due: First Monday)
Use the template in `docs/COMMUNICATION_PROCESS.md` to create:

1. **Implementation Progress Summary**
   - Current completion percentages by domain
   - Major milestones completed this month
   - Key technical achievements

2. **Security and Production Readiness**
   - Security audit progress
   - Production hardening updates
   - Operational readiness improvements

3. **Community Highlights**
   - New contributors and their contributions
   - Community feedback integration
   - Documentation improvements

4. **Current Focus Areas** and **Next Month Priorities**

### RFC Community Engagement
- **Create GitHub issues** for each RFC with specific questions for community
- **Monitor and respond** to community feedback on RFCs
- **Schedule RFC review meetings** with technical experts
- **Update RFC status** based on feedback and decisions

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Weekly check** for outdated information in key docs
- **Update implementation percentages** in PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md
- **Fix any documentation issues** reported by community

## RFC Implementation Workflow

### For Each RFC:

1. **Community Feedback Period** (2 weeks minimum)
   - Create GitHub issue linking to RFC
   - Actively solicit feedback from community
   - Respond to questions and concerns
   - Update RFC based on feedback

2. **Technical Review** (1 week)
   - Maintainer and expert review
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Implementation planning
   - Security and performance considerations

3. **Final Comment Period** (1 week)
   - Last call for community feedback
   - Address final concerns
   - Prepare for decision

4. **Decision and Next Steps**
   - Accept, reject, or request changes
   - Update RFC status
   - Create implementation issues if accepted
   - Communicate decision to community

## GitHub Issue Templates for RFCs

### RFC Discussion Issue Template
```markdown
# RFC Discussion: [RFC Title]

This issue is for discussing [RFC-XXX: Title](link-to-rfc).

## Summary
[Brief summary of the RFC]

## Key Questions for Community Input
1. [Specific question 1]
2. [Specific question 2]
3. [Specific question 3]

## How to Participate
- Read the full RFC: [link]
- Share your thoughts and concerns in comments below
- Suggest specific improvements or alternatives
- Ask questions about unclear aspects

## Timeline
- **Feedback Period**: [Start date] - [End date]
- **Technical Review**: [Dates]
- **Final Decision**: [Target date]

Related issues: #942 [add other relevant issue numbers]
```

## Quarterly Roadmap Review Process

### Preparation (Week before)
- [ ] **Gather progress data** from all domain areas
- [ ] **Review community feedback** from past quarter
- [ ] **Assess security and production readiness** progress
- [ ] **Identify roadmap adjustments** needed

### Review Content
- [ ] **Quarter summary** with achievements and challenges
- [ ] **Updated implementation status** percentages
- [ ] **Roadmap adjustments** based on progress and community input
- [ ] **Security and production status** assessment
- [ ] **Next quarter focus** areas and priorities

### Communication
- [ ] **Update PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md**
- [ ] **Create GitHub Discussion post** with quarterly review
- [ ] **Announce changes** to community
- [ ] **Schedule follow-up** as needed

## Community Engagement Best Practices

### Response Guidelines
- **Acknowledge contributions** and feedback promptly
- **Be transparent** about decision-making processes
- **Explain reasoning** behind decisions
- **Thank community members** for their participation

### Documentation Quality
- **Keep information current** with implementation reality
- **Use clear, accessible language** for all skill levels
- **Provide examples** and concrete guidance
- **Link related documentation** for comprehensive understanding

### Feedback Integration
- **Actively seek community input** on major decisions
- **Document how feedback was used** in decision-making
- **Close feedback loops** by reporting back on outcomes
- **Continuously improve processes** based on community needs

## Success Metrics to Track

### Community Engagement
- Number of participants in RFC discussions
- Community feedback quality and depth
- New contributor onboarding success
- Documentation issue reports and fixes

### Process Effectiveness
- Timeliness of regular updates
- Accuracy of documentation vs implementation
- Decision-making speed for design questions
- Community satisfaction with communication

### Project Progress
- Implementation completion rates
- Security audit and production readiness progress
- Community contribution volume and quality
- Overall project momentum and direction clarity

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Community Participation
- **Proactively reach out** to known community members
- **Simplify participation** barriers and requirements
- **Provide multiple ways** to give feedback
- **Acknowledge all contributions** publicly

### Documentation Drift
- **Set up automated reminders** for regular reviews
- **Assign specific responsibilities** for different docs
- **Create simple update processes** that are easy to follow
- **Monitor for drift indicators** regularly

### RFC Process Bottlenecks
- **Set clear timelines** and stick to them
- **Delegate review responsibilities** appropriately
- **Streamline decision-making** while maintaining quality
- **Learn from each RFC** to improve the process
