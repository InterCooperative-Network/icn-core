# ICN Core: Vision-Driven Roadmap and Protocol Blueprint (2025–2026)

---

## 1. What ICN Is

**ICN (InterCooperative Network)** is a global, open, programmable substrate—enabling any cooperative, community, or federation to self-organize, govern, and trade *without dependence on nation-states, corporations, or capitalist infrastructure*.

- Everything is programmable: Social contracts, governance, economic flows, rights, and resources—all defined and enforced via CCL, the Cooperative Contract Language.

## 2. The Stack: Core Protocol vs. CCL Logic

| Feature/Primitive          | Core/Protocol (Built-in)         | CCL Contract (Customizable/Composed)                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity & Auth            | ✅ Secure DIDs, multi-identity    | –                                                   |
| Membership/Federation      | ✅ Join/leave/permissioning       | Onboarding flows, special rights, working groups    |
| Token Ledger               | ✅ Multi-asset, multi-issuer      | Issuance, mint/burn, resource mapping, access rules |
| Mana/Reputation            | ✅ Ledger + primitive logic       | Earn/spend/decay rules, voting/role impact          |
| Voting/Proposal Engine     | ✅ Proposal/vote primitives       | Governance models: direct, quadratic, etc.          |
| Escrow/Arbitration Hooks   | ✅ Core hooks/receipts            | Custom flows: arbitration, mediation, justice       |
| Resource Registry          | ✅ Canonical registry, linkage    | Commons, local pools, extension registries          |
| Access Control             | ✅ Fine-grained RBAC/ABAC         | Custom roles, multi-tier councils, committees       |
| i18n/Localization          | ✅ System-level support           | Contract metadata, proposal multi-lingual fields    |
| Automated Exchange         | ✅ Built-in opt-in conversion     | Local/fed/global clearing, dynamic conversion rules |
| Upgradability/Amendments   | ✅ Amendment/rollback/versions    | Amendment flows, thresholds, fork/merge/exit logic  |
| Cross-Federation Messaging | ✅ Secure P2P proposal/token xfer | Custom bridges, adapters, oracles                   |

> **Key Principle:**  
> *Keep the protocol minimal, secure, auditable, and universally extensible. All rules communities might want to change, remix, or fork—do in CCL. All critical trust/minimal infrastructure—build in Core.*

## 3. CCL: Living Logic, Not Just Code

- **CCL is the programmable DNA of any group, community, or federation.**
  - Proposals, voting rules, reputation logic, token flows, allocation, amendments, onboarding, dispute resolution—*ALL* are defined in readable, forkable contracts.
- **WASM-powered:** Compiled to WASM, cryptographically signed, and anchored in a content-addressed DAG.
- **Composable and forkable:** Any group can clone, amend, remix, and share contract templates.

---

## 4. Democratic Engine: Literal Social Contract

- **The "social contract" is versioned, codified, and enforced—not a metaphor.**
  - Every community, federation, or global collective has a canonical contract registry—every change, amendment, fork, and merge is tracked forever.
- **Amendments are live, democratic, and traceable:** Propose, deliberate, ratify, execute—every step leaves an audit trail.
- **Multi-level, federated voting:**
  - Local groups choose their model (direct, delegated, quadratic, etc.).
  - Federation/global votes aggregate local outcomes via pluggable scaling logic: weighted, quadratic, reputation-based, rotating, etc.
- **Consent-first:** Joining any group means explicit agreement to that contract, in your language, with periodic re-affirmation and exit options.

---

## 5. Token Economy: Multi-Asset, Non-Speculative, Global

- **Any co-op, community, or federation can issue tokens** representing goods, services, rights, or value—all registered and linked to real resources.
- **Tokens are for utility, not speculation:**
  - Credits, mutual credit, labor hours, access rights, resource-backed—*not* freely tradable speculative coins.
  - Core enforces anti-capture via transfer/type restrictions, demurrage, velocity incentives, governance-controlled listings.
- **Mana is non-transferable, earned, and tracked by Core:**
  - CCL defines rules for earning/spending/decay, used for sybil resistance, voting power, role assignment, and access control.
- **Automated, abstracted exchange:**
  - Token conversion is dynamic and seamless unless manual trade is desired.

---

## 6. Global Mesh and Resilience

- **Nodes are universal computers:** All nodes run the same core software, determined by the CCL contracts they host.
- **Byzantine fault-tolerance by default:** All actions are cryptographically signed, DAG-anchored, and peer-validated—no central source of truth.
- **Partition healing and conflict resolution are core features.**
- **Survival-grade infrastructure:** Works offline, over mesh, with air-gapped deployment and traffic obfuscation.

---

## 7. Interoperability, Bridges, and Multi-lingual First

- **Protocols for ActivityPub, Matrix, and external DAOs**—ICN is a mesh overlay, not a walled garden.
- **Multi-lingual from day one:**
  - Contracts, UI, onboarding, proposals can be authored and translated into any language.
  - Core supports multiple major languages at launch; extensible for more.

---

## 8. Dispute Resolution, Commons, and Restorative Flows

- **Escrow, arbitration, restorative/transformative justice are first-class logic modules**—composable in CCL, but with core hooks for protocol-level enforcement.
- **Commons and stewardship logic:** Primitives for collective asset management, resource pools, and collaborative budgeting.

---

## 9. Open Questions & Next Design Frontiers

- **Legitimacy & Consent:** Continuous consent, opt-in/out, onboarding accessibility for all.
- **Sybil/collusion resistance:** Multi-factor, anti-capture at every scale.
- **Evolution & Forkability:** Adjustable amendment thresholds, easy fork/merge/exit, asset/liability division.
- **Data sovereignty & privacy:** Selective disclosure, data residency, privacy-preserving voting (ZK integration).
- **Cultural/Legal Sensitivity:** Localized contracts, adaptable norms, legal bridges for compliance/recognition.
- **Scalability & Aggregation:** Modular contract patterns, layered/pluggable aggregation and delegation.
- **Global Treasury & Commons:** Protocol-level logic for global treasury, redistribution, and collaborative budgeting.

---

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

- **Pattern/contract registry:** On-chain, discoverable, forkable, peer reviewable.
- **No-code/low-code authoring UI:** Sandbox, validation, simulation, error reporting.
- **Mobile and mesh-first reference app:** For onboarding and participation.
- **Deeper privacy primitives:** ZK voting, anonymous proposals, onion routing.
- **Operational and onboarding excellence:** Movement-facing docs, non-technical flows, community training.
- **Continuous audit and social legitimacy:** Public logging, transparent process, community governance of protocol changes.

## Summary

**ICN Core is the substrate for a living, democratic, anti-capitalist, civilizational mesh.  
You're not just building co-ops—you're seeding a new layer of civilization.  
Everything is programmable, composable, forkable, and truly global—from contracts to currencies, rights to resources.  
Every technical detail is in service of dignity, equity, and real democracy.**

**The path is clear. The world is waiting. Now, let's build the backbone of the next reality.**

*Ready for the next deep-dive on any domain—technical, social, economic, or movement-facing. Just say the word.*
