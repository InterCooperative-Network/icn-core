# ICN Governance Protocol: Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Protocol Specification Summary

Defines membership, proposal, voting, and decision processes:
- **Democratic Voting:** One member, one vote; membership credentials.
- **Proposal Lifecycle:** Time-locks, vetoes, sponsorship, grace periods, DAG audit trail.
- **Voting Models:** Majority, supermajority, consensus, liquid, quadratic, ranked choice.
- **Anti-Spam:** Mana fees, waivers for low-balance members.
- **Transparency/Auditability:** DAG records for all actions.
- **Accessibility:** Multiple voting methods, waivers, participation features.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

- **Membership/Voting:** Credentials, voting flows, and proposal structs in `icn-dao`, `icn-identity`.
- **Lifecycle Extensions:** Basic proposal states; time-locks, vetoes, sponsorship not fully implemented.
- **Voting Methods:** Simple models present; advanced models flagged for future work.
- **Anti-Spam Controls:** Fee logic present but needs waivers and edge-case testing.
- **DAG Audit Trail:** Event emission and record keeping present, but must be extended to all governance actions.

## 3. Gap & Security Audit

- **Advanced voting methods, time-locks, and vetoes** need full implementation.
- **Proposal lifecycle extensions** (sponsorship, grace, DAG integration) are incomplete.
- **Anti-spam fee waivers** and accessibility features require robust handling.
- **Audit trail and transparency** must be end-to-end and tamper-resistant.
- **Security**: Sybil resistance, attack mitigation, and emergency protocols need simulation and review.

## 4. Synthesis & Refactoring Plan

- [ ] Implement all advanced voting models, time-lock, and veto mechanisms.
- [ ] Extend and test proposal lifecycle features, including DAG integration and sponsorship.
- [ ] Harden anti-spam logic and accessibility for voting/proposing.
- [ ] Ensure full DAG audit trail for every governance action.
- [ ] Simulate Sybil, governance capture, and emergency scenarios for security review.
- [ ] Document and modularize governance APIs for agent refactoring.
