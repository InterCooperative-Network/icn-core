# ICN Economic Protocol: Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Protocol Specification Summary

The ICN Economic Protocol governs the networkâ€™s resource allocation, anti-speculation, membership, and trust mechanisms. Key features:
- **Mana Ledger:** Regenerative computational credits, anti-spam, fairness enforcer.
- **Token Operations:** Minting, transferring, burning, and class creation with mana costs.
- **Trust Engine:** Computes trust scores from credentials, participation, and endorsements.
- **Adversarial Validator:** Detects anomalies, validates operations, and enforces slashing.
- **Membership Lifecycle:** Democratic onboarding, credentials, non-transferable voting rights.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Privacy-preserving credential and job verification.
- **Security Model:** Slashing conditions, Sybil resistance, emergency response, immutable principles.
- **Economic Constants:** Mana caps, voting costs, slashing rates.
- **Interoperability:** REST/GraphQL APIs, W3C/ISO standards, legacy integration.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

- **ManaLedger, TokenLedger, TrustEngine, AdversarialValidator:** Traits and structs provided, with partial implementations in `icn-economics`, `icn-identity`, and protocol crate.
- **Membership Governance:** Rust trait for proposal, vote, credential issue/revoke; onboarding flows exist in `icn-identity`.
- **ZKP & Privacy:** Initial support for credential verification and privacy, but not fully hardened.
- **Economic flows:** Job marketplace, mana charging for WASM, governance proposals consuming mana; implemented in `icn-mesh`, `icn-dao`, `icn-runtime`.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Structs and enums for dispute processes, but flows need extension.
- **APIs/Formats:** REST/GraphQL/webhook interfaces and W3C/ISO format references present.

## 3. Gap & Security Audit

- **Anti-speculation features** (demurrage, velocity limits, purpose locks) need complete enforcement.
- **Slashing logic** and anomaly detection should be audited for reliability and abuse resistance.
- **Credential and ZKP flows** require robust property-based and adversarial testing.
- **Emergency modulation and governance capture defense**: logic should be hardened and subject to simulation.
- **Dispute resolution** and enforcement mechanisms need end-to-end coverage.
- **Legacy/External API integration** must be security-audited and standardized.
- **Economic constants** should be centrally managed and parameterized for governance adjustments.

## 4. Synthesis & Refactoring Plan

- [ ] Audit and extend all anti-speculation mechanisms (demurrage, velocity limits, purpose locks).
- [ ] Refactor slashing and anomaly detection logic, add attack scenario tests.
- [ ] Harden membership/credential flows with ZKP and privacy best-practices.
- [ ] Implement and simulate robust emergency modulation and governance capture defenses.
- [ ] Extend and test dispute resolution flows for all economic and governance actions.
- [ ] Standardize all API interfaces and legacy integration points, adhering to W3C/ISO.
- [ ] Parameterize economic constants and expose for governance adjustment.
- [ ] Document and test every module for adversarial and edge-case scenarios.
- [ ] Integrate roadmap progress indicators and assign tasks for ongoing agent-driven improvement.
