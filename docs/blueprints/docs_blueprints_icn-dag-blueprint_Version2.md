# ICN DAG Storage Protocol: Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Protocol Specification Summary

Foundation for all ICN operations:
- **IPLD Block Structure:** Content addressing, semantic links, block taxonomy.
- **Local-First, Federated Checkpointing:** Local DAG segments, federation-level checkpoints.
- **Archive Cooperatives:** Distributed, redundant, erasure-coded storage.
- **Economic Incentives:** Mana-metered operations, rebates, payouts for storage.
- **Security:** Adversarial resistance, cryptographic integrity, attack mitigation.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

- **IPLD/DAG Structs:** Block and link structs implemented, content-addressed storage logic in `icn-dag`, `icn-network`.
- **Federation Checkpointing:** Outlined, initial support, but multisig, reconciliation, and archive flows flagged as TODO.
- **Archive Node Roles:** Basic struct definitions, but full erasure coding and challenge protocol not complete.
- **Economic Integration:** Preliminary mana rebate and reward logic; needs robust, periodic incentive calculation.
- **Security:** Core cryptographic guarantees present; adversarial simulation/test coverage limited.

## 3. Gap & Security Audit

- **Checkpoint and archive flows** need full implementation and stress testing.
- **Incentive payout logic** must be robust, transparent, and attack-resistant.
- **Erasure coding and proof-of-storage** protocols need end-to-end coverage.
- **Adversarial scenarios** (forks, partition recovery, challenge failures) should be simulated.
- **Economic integration** with other layers must be audit-proof and consistent.

## 4. Synthesis & Refactoring Plan

- [ ] Implement full checkpoint manager, multisig, and reconciliation flows.
- [ ] Complete erasure coding and archive cooperative challenge protocols.
- [ ] Refactor and harden mana rebate and payout calculation logic.
- [ ] Build test harnesses for adversarial, fork, and partition scenarios.
- [ ] Integrate and document economic incentives with other protocol layers.
- [ ] Audit all cryptographic and integrity guarantees end-to-end.
- [ ] Assign modular implementation tasks for agent-driven improvement.
