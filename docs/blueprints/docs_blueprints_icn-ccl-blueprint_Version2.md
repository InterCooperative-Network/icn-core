# ICN Cooperative Contract Language (CCL) Protocol: Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Protocol Specification Summary

Defines smart contract system for governance, economics, and coordination:
- **Contract Structure:** Rust-like syntax, immutable parameters, mutable state, events.
- **Execution:** WASM sandbox, deterministic, metered by mana, capability-based security.
- **Governance/Economic Primitives:** Voting, consensus, resource sharing.
- **Federation-Aware:** Scoped contracts, cross-federation calls, audit trail.
- **Standard Library Patterns:** Pausable, Democratic, ReentrancyGuard, utility traits.
- **Formal Verification:** Property-based and invariant testing.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

- **Runtime & Compiler:** Initial contract runtime, WASM sandboxing, and compiler utilities in `ccl-core`.
- **Standard Library:** Basic patterns present, but not all traits (Pausable, Democratic, ReentrancyGuard) are fully implemented/tested.
- **Federation/Cross-Contract:** Partial support; cross-federation call protocol is flagged for future work.
- **Event/Audit Trail:** DAG event emission and auditability mechanisms in place.
- **Formal Verification:** Test harness and invariant checking not fully implemented.

## 3. Gap & Security Audit

- **Standard library coverage** is incomplete and needs full implementation/testing.
- **Federation scoping and cross-federation calls** need robust, secure flows.
- **WASM sandbox** and resource metering must be stress-tested for safety.
- **Formal verification** and property-based testing harnesses need to be built.
- **Audit trail and event emission** require end-to-end coverage and consistency checks.

## 4. Synthesis & Refactoring Plan

- [ ] Complete standard library coverage, fully implement and test all contract patterns.
- [ ] Harden WASM sandboxing and resource metering against edge cases and exploits.
- [ ] Implement federation and cross-federation contract logic with robust trust boundaries.
- [ ] Build formal verification and property-based test harness for all standard contracts.
- [ ] Ensure DAG event emission and audit trail coverage for every contract operation.
- [ ] Document contract APIs and provide secure upgrade/migration paths.
- [ ] Assign and track implementation tasks for agent-driven ongoing improvement.
