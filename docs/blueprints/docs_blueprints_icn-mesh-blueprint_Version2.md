# ICN Mesh Job Protocol: Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Protocol Specification Summary

Distributed job execution and verification:
- **Job Spec:** Identity, runtime, code, input, compute/storage/network needs, payment, privacy, accuracy, determinism.
- **Execution:** WASM, Docker, Native runtimes; bid/assign/execute/complete flows.
- **Privacy & Validation:** ZK proofs, multi-validator, dispute mechanisms.
- **Economic Flows:** Bid scoring, mana locking, payment/reward/slashing.
- **Sharding & Federated Learning:** Scalable, privacy-preserving distributed computation.

## 2. Current Implementation Analysis

- **Job Structs & Execution:** Core job, bid, and receipt flows in `icn-mesh` and protocol crates.
- **Runtimes:** WASM execution present; Docker and sharding flagged for future work.
- **Privacy/Validation:** Initial support for validator sampling; ZK and dispute flows incomplete.
- **Economic Flows:** Bid scoring and payment logic present, but needs robust slashing and feedback loops.
- **Federated Learning:** Coordination logic outlined, not implemented.

## 3. Gap & Security Audit

- **Docker sandboxing, sharded execution, federated learning** need full implementation and testing.
- **Dispute/validation flows** must be robust and attack-resistant.
- **ZK privacy features** require full cryptographic and performance audit.
- **Economic logic** must be stress-tested for fairness and abuse prevention.
- **Security:** Validator slashing, job failure, and privacy leaks to be simulated.

## 4. Synthesis & Refactoring Plan

- [ ] Implement Docker sandboxing and sharding logic for job execution.
- [ ] Build federated learning primitives and coordination flows.
- [ ] Harden dispute and validation flows for all execution paths.
- [ ] Complete ZK proof support for private jobs and credential verification.
- [ ] Refactor bid scoring, payment, and slashing for robustness.
- [ ] Simulate and audit all security-critical job flows.
- [ ] Modularize mesh job APIs for agent-led refactoring.
