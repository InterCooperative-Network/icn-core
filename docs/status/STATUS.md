# ICN Core Status Report

**Version**: 0.2.0-beta  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Overall Progress**: Heavy Development - Many Stubs Remain  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT Production Ready**

---

## üöß Executive Summary

ICN Core is **experimental software under active development** with significant portions stubbed or incomplete. While the architecture is well-designed and demonstrates promising concepts, **this is not production-ready infrastructure**.

**Current Reality**: Many services return mock data, core algorithms are unimplemented, and security mechanisms need substantial work before any production use.

**Development Focus**: Replace stub implementations, complete TODO items, and implement real functionality behind the well-designed API surface.

## üìä Implementation Progress

### Overall Status by Domain

| Domain | Complete | Partial | Stub/TODO | Progress |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Foundation** | 3/9 | 4/9 | 2/9 | **~40%** |
| **Mesh Computing** | 2/9 | 3/9 | 4/9 | **~30%** |
| **Governance** | 2/11 | 4/11 | 5/11 | **~25%** |
| **Economics** | 1/12 | 3/12 | 8/12 | **~20%** |
| **Security** | 2/9 | 3/9 | 4/9 | **~30%** |
| **Networking** | 3/8 | 2/8 | 3/8 | **~40%** |
| **Storage** | 2/7 | 2/7 | 3/7 | **~35%** |

### Working Components ‚úÖ

- **Basic P2P Setup**: libp2p integration with basic messaging (limited features)
- **API Framework**: HTTP endpoints structured (many return mock data)  
- **Database Layer**: Storage backends connected (data models may be incomplete)
- **Frontend Scaffolding**: UI applications built (connecting to stub backends)

### In Development ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Job Execution**: Basic framework exists, scheduling/bidding algorithms stubbed
- **Governance**: Proposal structures defined, voting mechanisms partially implemented
- **Identity**: DID framework in place, key management needs security review
- **Economic System**: Mana concepts implemented, transaction logic incomplete

---

## ÔøΩ Current Capabilities (What Actually Works)

### Basic Development Environment
- **Development setup** with containerized devnet (may have limitations)
- **API server** that starts and responds to basic requests (many endpoints stubbed)
- **Database connections** to multiple backend types (data consistency uncertain)
- **Frontend applications** that build and run (connected to mock/stub backends)

### Demonstration Features
- **P2P node startup** and basic peer discovery (reliability varies)
- **Job submission interface** through CLI/API (execution may be mocked)
- **Governance UI** with proposal creation (voting algorithms may be incomplete)
- **Economic resource sharing** with mana transfers between nodes

### Mesh Computing
- **Job submission** via HTTP API or CLI
- **Automatic executor selection** based on reputation and available resources
- **WASM job execution** with security constraints and resource limits
- **Cryptographic receipts** with content-addressed storage and verification

### Democratic Governance
- **Proposal creation** with CCL contract compilation
- **Voting mechanisms** with quorum enforcement and signature verification
- **Member management** including invite/remove operations
- **Policy execution** that affects network parameters and behavior

### Economic Management
- **Mana allocation** and time-based regeneration
- **Resource accounting** for all operations with persistent transaction logs
- **Multi-backend persistence** (SQLite, PostgreSQL, RocksDB, Sled)
- **Economic policy enforcement** preventing resource abuse

## üîß Current Phase: Configuration Management

### Key Finding
The remaining work is **configuration management**, not missing implementations. Production services exist and work - they need to be used by default.

### Service Status

| Component | Stub Service | Production Service | Status |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Mesh Networking** | `StubMeshNetworkService` | `DefaultMeshNetworkService` | ‚úÖ Ready |
| **Cryptographic Signing** | `StubSigner` | `Ed25519Signer` | ‚úÖ Ready |
| **DAG Storage** | `StubDagStore` | PostgreSQL/RocksDB/SQLite/Sled | ‚úÖ Ready |
| **P2P Networking** | N/A | `LibP2pNetworkService` | ‚úÖ In Use |
| **Governance** | N/A | `GovernanceModule` | ‚úÖ In Use |
| **Reputation** | N/A | `ReputationStore` | ‚úÖ In Use |
