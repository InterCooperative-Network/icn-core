# InterCooperative Network Economic & Incentive Protocol
## Definitive Specification

---

## Executive Summary

The InterCooperative Network (ICN) implements a novel economic protocol that reconciles two seemingly contradictory requirements: **adversarial security at the computational layer** and **cooperative coordination at the social layer**. This is achieved through a multi-layered architecture where cryptographic trust and resource-backed incentives create a resilient foundation for democratic cooperation.

The protocol introduces **mana** as a regenerative computational credit that reflects actual resource contribution to the network, preventing speculation while enabling fair resource allocation. Organizations are differentiated by function—**Cooperatives** as economic engines, **Communities** as governance infrastructure, and **Federations** as coordination bridges—each with tailored incentive structures that align with their social purpose.

**Critically, voting rights in the ICN are based on membership, not economic assets.** While membership may be represented by non-transferable credentials, the network ensures that democratic participation is never contingent upon wealth accumulation. This fundamental principle prevents plutocratic capture while maintaining robust anti-spam mechanisms through nominal mana fees. In the mesh compute lifecycle, mana serves strictly as a metering and anti-spam mechanism for submitters; executors are incentivized through reputation/trust increases and access privileges, not direct mana payouts.

## 0 · Scope and Implementation Alignment (Normative)

### 0.1 Implemented
- Mana: balances, regeneration, charging/refunds; policy hooks
- Basic token primitives for resource accounting; ledgers (file/sled/sqlite/rocks)

### 0.2 Pending Extensions
- Full demurrage/token policy contracts via CCL
- Insurance pools, slashing frameworks, and dispute resolution
- Federation treasury mechanics and budgeting at scale

### 0.3 Mappings
- Crates: `icn-economics` (mana, ledgers), governance coupling in `icn-governance`

---

## 1. Core Design Principles

### 1.1 Adversarial-by-Default, Cooperative-by-Design
- **Machine Layer**: Every node, transaction, and message is untrusted until cryptographically proven
- **Social Layer**: Communities and cooperatives implement democratic governance atop secure foundations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Social trust never weakens computational security guarantees

### 1.2 Resource-Anchored Economics
- All economic value derives from verifiable computational contribution
- No speculative tokens or arbitrary value creation
- Resource credits (mana) are non-transferable: they regenerate based on capacity and are minted as earned credits for verified contributions

### 1.3 Democratic Autonomy
- Organizations self-govern through transparent, auditable contracts
- **Voting rights derive from membership, not wealth or assets**
- One member = one vote, regardless of economic holdings
- Federation structures enable voluntary coordination without centralization
- Emergency protocols protect network integrity while preserving local autonomy

---

## 2. Identity & Cryptographic Trust Layer

### 2.1 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
```
DID Structure: did:icn:<organization-type>:<unique-identifier>
```

| Component | Function | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **DID Document** | W3C-compliant identity root anchored in DAG | Initial mana burn (anti-Sybil) |
| **Key Rotation** | Cryptographic key updates with revocation registry | Nominal mana fee |
| **Organizational Binding** | Links DIDs to co-ops, communities, or federations | Governance approval + mana stake |

### 2.2 Verifiable Credentials & Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Credential Types:**
- `OrganizationMember`: Non-transferable membership granting voting rights
- `ResourceProvider`: Attests to compute/storage/bandwidth capacity
- `CommunityMember`: Governance participation rights in specific community
- `FederationValidator`: Cross-org coordination authority
- `TrustedExecutor`: Mesh job execution reputation

**Critical Principle:** Membership credentials grant voting rights independent of economic holdings. These credentials are soul-bound (non-transferable) and represent belonging, not wealth.

**Membership Lifecycle:**
```rust
// Membership is granted through democratic process, not purchase
pub trait MembershipGovernance {
    fn propose_member(candidate: DID, sponsor: DID) -> ProposalId;
    fn vote_on_membership(proposal: ProposalId, vote: bool) -> Result<()>;
    fn issue_membership_credential(did: DID) -> MembershipCredential;
    fn revoke_membership(did: DID, reason: RevocationReason) -> Result<()>;
}
```

**ZKP Applications:**
- Prove credential possession without revealing identity
- Verify job execution without exposing job contents
- Demonstrate token ownership while preserving transaction privacy
- Validate governance participation without vote disclosure

### 2.3 Trust Score Computation
## 3. Mana Accounting and Issuance

### 3.1 Mana Characteristics
- Non-transferable, per-account capacity credit
- Two sources: regeneration (policy-driven) and earned credits (via contribution)
- Spent by submitters for metered operations (jobs, storage writes, governance ops as configured)

### 3.2 Earned Mana Credits (Executors)
- On verified job completion, executors receive minted mana credits proportional to measured contribution
- Disputed completions may receive reduced or zero credits based on consensus
- Credits affect available capacity and can increase regeneration multipliers via policy

### 3.3 Policy Hooks
- Regen multiplier: function of reputation and recent contribution
- Temporary capacity bonus: function of recent earned mana
- Governance may set sector-specific weights (e.g., GPU heavy tasks)


```
Trust Multiplier β = f(credential_weight, execution_history, governance_participation, federation_endorsements)
Range: 0.5 ≤ β ≤ 2.0
```

Trust accumulates through:
- Successful job completions (+0.01 per receipt)
- Governance participation (+0.02 per validated vote)
- Credential verification (+0.1-0.5 based on credential type)
- Federation endorsements (+0.2 per endorsing federation)

---

## 3. Regenerative Mana System

### 3.1 Mana as Computational Energy

Mana represents **potential computational work** within the network, functioning as:
- **Access Control**: Required for all network operations
- **Anti-Spam Mechanism**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Fairness Enforcer**: Proportional to actual contribution

### 3.2 Regeneration Mathematics

**Core Variables:**
- σ = Compute Score (normalized 0-1)
- β = Trust Multiplier (0.5-2.0)
- η = Recent Participation Factor (0.25-1.5)
- γ = Governance Engagement (0.5-1.5)
- κ_org = Organizational Role Weight

**Regeneration Formula:**
```
R(t) = κ_org × σ × β × η × network_health_factor
```

**Maximum Capacity:**
```
M_max = base_capacity × κ_org × σ × γ × (1 + federation_bonus)
```

### 3.3 Compute Score Calculation

```
σ = weighted_sum(
    cpu_cores × 0.25,
    memory_gb × 0.20,
    storage_tb × 0.15,
    bandwidth_mbps × 0.15,
    gpu_units × 0.10,
    uptime_percentage × 0.10,
    job_success_rate × 0.05
) / network_average
```

### 3.4 Organizational Weights

| Organization Type | κ_org | Rationale |
|------------------|-------|-----------|
| **Cooperative** | 1.00 | Economic production baseline; worker-members have equal voting rights |
| **Community** | 0.95 | Civic infrastructure with high governance multipliers; all community members vote equally |
| **Federation** | 1.25 | Coordination premium for cross-org bridges; delegate voting from member orgs |
| **Default ICN Federation** | 1.10 | Global baseline with bootstrap advantages |
| **Unaffiliated/Mobile** | 0.70 | Limited until organizational affiliation grants membership |

### 3.5 Emergency Modulation

During network attacks or instability:
```
emergency_factor = detect_anomaly() ? 0.25 : 1.0
R_emergency = R × emergency_factor
```

---

## 4. Token Layer (Purpose-Bound Value)

### 4.1 Token Classifications

| Class | Issuer | Properties | Examples |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Resource** | Cooperatives | Redeemable for compute/storage | `cpu-hour`, `storage-gb-month` |
| **Service** | Any Organization | Specific service claims | `translation-hour`, `audit-service` |
| **Labour** | Communities/Co-ops | Human work representation | `teaching-hour`, `farm-labour` |
| **Mutual Credit** | Communities | Zero-interest credit lines | `community-credit`, `emergency-aid` |
| **Membership** | Communities/Co-ops | Non-transferable, represents belonging | `coop-member`, `community-citizen` |

### 4.2 Token Operations

All token operations require mana expenditure:

```rust
pub trait TokenOperations {
    fn create_class(class: TokenClass, governance_approval: Proof) -> Result<ClassId>;
    fn mint(class_id: ClassId, amount: u64, recipient: DID) -> Result<MintReceipt>;
    fn transfer(from: DID, to: DID, amount: u64) -> Result<TransferReceipt>;
    fn burn(owner: DID, amount: u64) -> Result<BurnReceipt>;
}

pub trait MembershipTokens {
    // Membership tokens have special rules
    fn issue_membership(recipient: DID, org: OrganizationId) -> Result<MembershipToken>;
    fn revoke_membership(member: DID, reason: RevocationReason) -> Result<()>;
    // fn transfer() -> NOT ALLOWED for membership tokens
}
```

**Mana Costs:**
- Create Class: 100 mana (one-time)
- Mint: 0.1 mana per token
- Transfer: 0.01 mana per token (not applicable to membership)
- Burn: 0.001 mana per token
- Issue Membership: 10 mana (governance action)

### 4.3 Anti-Speculation Mechanisms

- **Soul-Binding**: Membership tokens and certain credentials are permanently non-transferable
- **Democratic Firewall**: Voting rights cannot be bought, sold, or delegated beyond organization rules
- **Demurrage**: Automatic value decay for hoarded resource tokens
- **Velocity Limits**: Maximum transfers per epoch for tradeable tokens
- **Purpose Locks**: Tokens only redeemable for specified goods/services

---

## 5. Mesh Job Economic Flow

### 5.1 Job Lifecycle Economics

| Phase | Economic Actions | Mana Dynamics |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| **Submit** | Job spec + estimated cost posted | Submitter locks cost estimate |
| **Bid** | Executors propose price & timeline | Bidders prove mana capacity |
| **Assign** | Winning bid selected by algorithm | Executor locks bid amount |
| **Execute** | Job runs with progress checkpoints | Mana remains locked |
| **Complete** | Receipt generated & validated | Success: refund + reward; Failure: slash |

### 5.2 Bid Scoring Algorithm

```
score = (
    compute_match × 0.30 +
    price_competitiveness × 0.25 +
    trust_score × 0.20 +
    locality_bonus × 0.15 +
    federation_affinity × 0.10
)
```

### 5.3 Economic Feedback Loops

**Success Path:**
- Executor: +mana reward, +trust score, +reputation
- Submitter: -mana cost, +completed job
- Network: +DAG receipt, +trust signal

**Failure Path:**
- Executor: -locked mana (slashed), -trust score
- Submitter: Refund (minus network fee)
- Network: +slashing record, trust adjustment

---

## 6. Cooperative Contract Language (CCL) Integration

### 6.1 Economic Policy Contracts

CCL enables programmable economic rules:

```rust
contract TokenPolicy {
    max_supply: Option<u64>,
    transferable: bool,
    demurrage_rate: Option<f64>,
    governance_threshold: f64,
    emergency_freeze: bool,
}

contract ManaPolicy {
    regen_multiplier: f64,
    participation_bonus: f64,
    slashing_percentage: f64,
    minimum_stake: u64,
}
```

### 6.2 Governance Integration

**Voting Rights Principle:**
Voting rights derive from **membership**, not asset ownership. Organizations may issue non-transferable membership credentials that confer voting rights. One member = one vote, regardless of mana balance or token holdings.

**Key Distinction from Token-Weighted DAOs:**
Unlike traditional blockchain DAOs where voting power correlates with token holdings, ICN implements true democratic governance. Membership is earned through participation and granted by existing members, not purchased. This prevents plutocratic capture while maintaining Sybil resistance through the membership approval process itself.

**Anti-Spam Mana Costs:**
Small mana fees prevent spam but must never bar legitimate participation:
- **Proposal Submission**: 50-500 mana (refundable if proposal reaches quorum)
- **Voting**: 0.1-1 mana (waived for members below minimum balance)
- **Delegation**: 5 mana (optional; direct voting always available)
- **Emergency Actions**: 1000+ mana stake (for initiating only; all members can vote)

**Membership Verification:**
```rust
contract VotingRights {
    // Membership credential grants voting rights
    fn can_vote(&self, did: &DID) -> bool {
        self.has_valid_membership_credential(did)
        // NOT based on token balance or mana amount
    }
    
    // Organizations can waive mana costs for active members
    fn voting_fee(&self, did: &DID) -> u64 {
        if self.is_active_member(did) && self.below_minimum_mana(did) {
            0 // No barrier to participation
        } else {
            1 // Nominal anti-spam fee
        }
    }
}
```

## 7. Content-Addressable DAG Backbone

### 7.1 Immutable Economic History

| Artifact Type | Hash Content | Verification Method |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Identity** | DID documents, key rotations | Signature chain |
| **Credentials** | Credential issuance, revocations | ZK membership proofs |
| **Economic** | Token mints, transfers, burns | Merkle inclusion proofs |
| **Governance** | Proposals, votes, outcomes | BFT finalization |
| **Execution** | Job specs, bids, receipts | Multi-party signatures |
| **Federation** | Membership changes, checkpoints | Consensus snapshots |

### 7.2 DAG-Mana Interaction

Every DAG write operation requires mana:
- **Small writes** (<1KB): 0.01 mana
- **Medium writes** (1-10KB): 0.1 mana
- **Large writes** (>10KB): 1.0 mana

This creates natural rate-limiting and accountability.

## 8. Federation Architecture

### 8.1 Organizational Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Default ICN Federation        │ ← Global fallback & bootstrap
└──────────┬──────────────────────┘
           │
    ┌──────┴──────┬────────────┬────────────┐
    ▼             ▼            ▼            ▼
Federation A  Federation B  Federation C  Unaffiliated
    │             │            │            Nodes
    ├─Co-op 1     ├─Co-op 3    ├─Community 2
    ├─Co-op 2     └─Community 1└─Federation D
    └─Community A                  ├─Co-op 4
                                   └─Co-op 5
```

**Cooperative Governance:** Worker cooperatives follow democratic principles where each worker-member has equal voting rights regardless of their capital contribution or mana balance.

**Community Governance:** Communities operate as democratic bodies where all recognized members have equal voice in decisions affecting the community.

**Federation Governance:** Federations typically use delegated democracy where member organizations appoint representatives, but internal federation rules may vary.

### 8.2 Federation Services

| Service | Function | Mana Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Bridge Registry** | Cross-federation routing | 10 mana/epoch |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Multi-party arbitration | 100 mana/case |
| **Resource Balancing** | Load distribution algorithms | 5 mana/rebalance |
| **Emergency Coordination** | Crisis response protocols | 0 (waived during emergency) |

### 8.3 Default ICN Federation

Special properties:
- **Genesis Validators**: Bootstrap network with initial trust
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Coordinate network-wide updates
- **Fallback Coordination**: Maintain connectivity during partitions
- **Baseline Standards**: Define minimum interoperability requirements

---

## 9. Security Model

### 9.1 Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Validator Requirements:**
- Minimum 67% honest validator assumption
- Cryptographic signatures on all state transitions
- Periodic validator rotation based on trust scores

**Consensus Layers:**
- **Economic Operations**: 67% validator quorum
- **Governance Decisions**: Variable threshold (50-90% based on impact)
- **Emergency Actions**: 80% super-majority

### 9.2 Attack Mitigation

| Attack Vector | Defense Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Sybil Attack** | DID creation mana burn, trust accumulation period |
| **Eclipse Attack** | Multi-path gossip, federation-level redundancy |
| **Velocity Attack** | Rate limiting, anomaly detection, emergency freeze |
| **Governance Capture** | Membership-based voting (not token-weighted), time-locks, federation oversight |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Mana-gated operations, dynamic pricing |

### 9.3 Slashing Conditions

Automatic slashing triggers:
- Job execution failure (without valid excuse): -10% locked mana
- Invalid validation signature: -25% stake
- Governance manipulation attempt: -50% stake + credential revocation
- Network attack participation: -100% stake + permanent ban

---

## 10. Implementation Requirements

### 10.1 Core Modules

## 13. Membership Lifecycle & Onboarding

### 13.1 Individual Membership Process

**New Member Onboarding:**
```rust
pub struct MembershipApplication {
    candidate_did: DID,
    sponsor_did: DID,  // Existing member who vouches
    contribution_statement: String,
    skills_attestation: Vec<SkillCredential>,
    availability_commitment: HoursPerWeek,
    values_agreement: SignedAgreement,
}

// Process flow
1. APPLICATION: Candidate finds sponsor, submits application
2. REVIEW: 7-day community review period (can ask questions)
3. VOTE: Simple majority of existing members (quorum: 25%)
4. PROBATION: 30-day probationary period with limited rights
5. FULL MEMBERSHIP: Full voting rights after successful probation
```

**Membership Tiers:**
| Tier | Rights | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Applicant** | Can observe, cannot vote | Sponsored application submitted |
| **Probationary** | Can participate, limited voting | Approved by members |
| **Full Member** | Full voting and proposal rights | Completed probation |
| **Emeritus** | Honorary status, advisory role | Long service, reduced activity |

### 13.2 Organizational Onboarding

**New Cooperative/Community Formation:**
```rust
pub struct OrganizationFormation {
    founding_members: Vec<DID>,  // Minimum 3
    charter: OrganizationCharter,
    initial_resources: ResourceCommitment,
    federation_sponsor: Option<FederationId>,
}

// Requirements
- Minimum 3 founding members with existing DIDs
- Ratified charter including governance rules
- Initial mana stake: 1000 (refundable after 6 months)
- Optional: Federation sponsorship for faster trust building
```

### 13.3 Federation Joining Process

**Cross-Organization Membership:**
- Members can belong to multiple organizations
- Primary affiliation determines mana regeneration bonus
- Voting rights exist separately in each organization
- Conflicts of interest must be declared

---

## 14. Dispute Resolution Framework

### 14.1 Dispute Categories

| Type | Mechanism | Arbiter |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Economic** | Smart contract mediation → Human review | Federation economic committee |
| **Governance** | Constitutional review → Member vote | Community assembly |
| **Technical** | Automated validation → Expert panel | Technical working group |
| **Inter-org** | Negotiation → Federation arbitration | Federation council |

### 14.2 Resolution Process

```rust
pub enum DisputeResolution {
    AutomatedSettlement,      // Smart contract can resolve
    MediationRequired,         // Human mediator needed
    ArbitrationRequired,       // Binding arbitration
    FederationEscalation,     // Escalate to federation level
}

pub struct DisputeProcess {
    fn file_dispute(complainant: DID, respondent: DID, evidence: Evidence) -> DisputeId;
    fn assign_mediator(dispute: DisputeId) -> MediatorId;
    fn submit_evidence(party: DID, evidence: Evidence) -> Result<()>;
    fn render_decision(mediator: MediatorId, decision: Decision) -> Result<()>;
    fn appeal(party: DID, grounds: AppealGrounds) -> Result<AppealId>;
}
```

**Escalation Path:**
1. **Direct Resolution** (0 mana): Parties attempt to resolve directly
2. **Mediation** (10 mana stake): Neutral mediator facilitates
3. **Arbitration** (100 mana stake): Binding decision by panel
4. **Federation Appeal** (500 mana stake): Final appeal to federation

### 14.3 Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Economic**: Automatic escrow and settlement via smart contracts
- **Reputational**: Trust score adjustments, credential revocation
- **Exclusion**: Temporary or permanent membership suspension
- **Compensation**: Mandated restitution or service credits

## 15. Mobile & Edge Device Participation

### 15.1 Device Classification

```rust
pub enum DeviceClass {
    Mobile {           // Phones, tablets
        intermittent: bool,
        battery_powered: bool,
        bandwidth: BandwidthClass,
    },
    EdgeCompute {      // IoT, embedded systems
        specialized: bool,
        always_on: bool,
        sensors: Vec<SensorType>,
    },
    Laptop {           // Personal computers
        gpu_available: bool,
        availability_hours: f32,
    },
    HomeServer {       // Always-on personal infrastructure
        dedicated: bool,
        bandwidth: BandwidthClass,
    },
}
```

### 15.2 Mobile Participation Modes

**Lightweight Contributions:**
- **Gossip Relay**: Forward network messages (0.01 mana/MB)
- **Sensor Data**: Environmental monitoring (0.1 mana/reading)
- **Availability Beacon**: Network presence signaling (0.001 mana/hour)
- **Microtask Execution**: Small WASM jobs (<1 second) (1 mana/task)

**Collective Mobile Compute:**
```rust
// Mobile devices can pool resources
pub struct MobileCluster {
    devices: Vec<MobileDID>,
    coordinator: DID,  // Usually a community node
    aggregate_compute: ComputeScore,
    availability_window: TimeRange,
}

// Pooled mobile devices share rewards
// Example: 100 phones = 1 modest server equivalent
```

### 15.3 Progressive Enhancement

```rust
// Devices earn trust and capabilities over time
pub struct DeviceProgression {
    stage: ProgressionStage,
    contributions: u64,
    uptime_hours: f32,
    successful_tasks: u32,
}

pub enum ProgressionStage {
    Unverified,      // κ = 0.3, minimal mana
    Verified,        // κ = 0.5, sensor tasks
    Contributor,     // κ = 0.7, micro compute
    Trusted,         // κ = 0.9, participate in clusters
}
```

## 16. Emergency Scenarios & Responses

### 16.1 Attack Scenarios

**Sybil Storm:**
```rust
// Trigger: >100 DID creations per hour from similar network segments
Response {
    increase_did_mana_cost: 10x,
    require_additional_proofs: true,
    quarantine_period: 72_hours,
    federation_alert: AlertLevel::High,
}
```

**Economic Drain Attack:**
```rust
// Trigger: >50% of network mana spent in 1 hour
Response {
    global_rate_limit: 0.1x_normal,
    freeze_large_transfers: true,
    require_multi_sig: 3_of_5_validators,
    emergency_vote: "Continue/Rollback",
}
```

**Governance Capture Attempt:**
```rust
// Trigger: Unusual voting patterns or proposal spam

## 17. Data Privacy & Compliance

### 17.1 Privacy Architecture

**Data Classification:**
| Level | Description | Storage | Access |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Public** | DID documents, public credentials | DAG | Anyone |
| **Protected** | Transaction details, votes | Encrypted DAG | Participants only |
| **Private** | Personal data, raw credentials | Off-chain | Owner only |
| **Forgotten** | GDPR-deleted data | Cryptographic tombstone | Nobody |

### 17.2 GDPR Compliance

```rust
pub trait PrivacyRights {
    // Right to access
    fn export_personal_data(did: DID) -> PersonalDataArchive;
    
    // Right to rectification  
    fn update_personal_data(did: DID, updates: DataUpdates) -> Result<()>;
    
    // Right to erasure
    fn request_deletion(did: DID) -> DeletionRequest;
    
    // Right to portability
    fn export_portable_data(did: DID) -> PortableDataFormat;
}

// Cryptographic deletion for immutable DAG
pub struct CryptographicDeletion {
    original_hash: Hash,
    deletion_proof: DeletionProof,
    tombstone: EncryptedTombstone,
    // Original data key is destroyed
}
```

### 17.3 Zero-Knowledge Data Handling

**Private Compute:**
```rust
// Compute on encrypted data without decryption
pub trait PrivateCompute {
    fn submit_encrypted_job(job: EncryptedJob) -> JobId;
    fn compute_on_encrypted(input: EncryptedData) -> EncryptedResult;
    fn verify_computation(proof: ComputationProof) -> bool;
}

// Privacy-preserving aggregation
pub fn aggregate_private_votes(votes: Vec<EncryptedVote>) -> AggregateResult {
    // Homomorphic addition without decrypting individual votes
    homomorphic_sum(votes)
}
```

let job = RenderJob {
    frames: 10_000,
    compute_requirement: high_gpu(),
    deadline: 48_hours,
    budget: ResourceTokens::new("gpu-hours", 5000),
};

// Workflow
1. Studio posts job with 5000 GPU-hour tokens
2. Three co-ops bid: 
   - CoopA: 4500 tokens, 36 hours
   - CoopB: 4800 tokens, 40 hours  
   - CoopC: 5000 tokens, 30 hours
3. Algorithm selects CoopC (fastest, acceptable price)
4. CoopC locks 500 mana as performance bond
5. Job executes across 50 GPUs in parallel
6. On completion:
   - CoopC receives 5000 GPU-hour tokens + 50 mana bonus
   - Studio receives rendered frames
   - Trust scores update for both parties
```

### 22.2 Scenario: Community Mutual Aid

```rust
// Natural disaster affects community
let emergency = FloodEvent {
    affected_community: "riverside-commons",
    members_impacted: 450,
    infrastructure_damage: Severity::High,
};

// Response
1. Community activates emergency protocol
2. Federation releases 50,000 mana from reserve
3. Sister communities contribute:
   - Computing resources (free job execution)
   - Storage tokens (backup services)
   - Labor tokens (reconstruction help)
4. Affected members receive:
   - Mana grants (100 each for immediate needs)
   - Waived fees for 30 days
   - Priority job execution
5. Recovery coordinator tracks aid distribution
6. Post-recovery: Community contributes back to reserve
```

### 22.3 Scenario: Mobile Mesh Network

```rust
// Rural area with limited infrastructure
let mesh_network = MobileCoordination {
    devices: 500_smartphones,
    coordinator: "rural-connect-coop",
    coverage_area: "50 sq km",
};

// Operation
1. Each phone contributes:
   - 1 CPU core (when charging)
   - 2GB storage
   - Mesh networking relay
2. Aggregate capacity:
   - 500 CPU cores (intermittent)
   - 1TB distributed storage
   - Local communication network
3. Mana generation:
   - Each phone: 10 mana/day
   - Coordinator: 100 mana/day
   - Total network: 5,100 mana/day
4. Services provided:
   - Local messaging (no internet required)
   - Distributed backup
   - Emergency communication
   - Micro-computations
```

## Appendix D: Mathematical Formulas Reference

### Core Mana Equations
```
Regeneration Rate: R(t) = κ_org × σ × β × η × γ_network
Maximum Capacity: M_max = base × κ_org × σ × γ × (1 + federation_bonus)
Trust Update: β(t+1) = β(t) + Δ_success - Δ_failure
Compute Score: σ = Σ(w_i × resource_i) / network_average
```

### Economic Formulas
```
Token Velocity: V = Volume / Supply × Time
Gini Coefficient: G = (Σ|x_i - x_j|) / (2n²μ)
Price Discovery: P = (Supply × Demand_factor) / (Velocity × Trust)
Slashing Amount: S = stake × min(severity × base_rate, 1.0)
```

### Governance Equations
```
Quorum: Q = max(0.25 × members, minimum_participants)
Vote Weight: W = membership ? 1.0 : 0.0  // Always equal
Proposal Cost: C = base_cost × (1 + complexity_factor)
Decision Threshold: T = simple_majority | super_majority | consensus
