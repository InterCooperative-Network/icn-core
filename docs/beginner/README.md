# ICN Core Beginner Quickstart

This guide helps you get started with the InterCooperative Network core repository. ICN Core is **advanced development software** with substantial working implementations across cooperative infrastructure domains.

## üöß What You're Getting Into

ICN Core is **NOT production-ready** but has significantly more functional code than typical early-stage projects:
- ‚úÖ **CCL WASM Compilation**: Full pipeline working
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Backend Storage**: PostgreSQL, RocksDB, SQLite, Sled operational
- ‚úÖ **P2P Networking**: libp2p with gossipsub and Kademlia DHT working
- ‚úÖ **Governance & Economics**: Voting, mana ledgers, resource tokens functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Review Needed**: Cryptographic implementations need production audit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scale Testing Required**: Works in development, needs production-scale validation

**Current Focus**: Security hardening, production readiness, and operational excellence.

## Quick Start (10 Minutes)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InterCooperative-Network/icn-core
cd icn-core
just setup                    # install dependencies and tools
```

### 2. Verify Current State
```bash
just test-quick               # run basic tests (no persistence features)
just build                   # build with default features
```

### 3. Explore the Federation
```bash
just devnet                  # start 3-node test federation (if build successful)
```
