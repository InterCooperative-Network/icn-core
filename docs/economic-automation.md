# Economic Automation Engine

The economic automation engine coordinates policy enforcement, health monitoring, market making and predictive analytics for the ICN economy.

## Policy Enforcement

Active policies are evaluated against the ledger to maintain healthy balances and discourage manipulation. For example, a *mana regeneration* policy can ensure that every account maintains a minimum balance while anti-manipulation rules cap excessive accumulation.

## Health Monitoring

Regular checks calculate inequality and overall economic health from ledger data. When metrics fall below safe thresholds, `ThresholdReached` events are emitted so governance layers can react.

## Market Making

Simple market making logic quotes buy and sell prices around each resource's current value and records resulting trades. Performance metrics track spread capture and trade volume.

## Predictive Modeling

Price history and account activity feed lightweight predictive models that update pricing estimates and activity indicators. These models help tune regeneration rates and other policy parameters.
