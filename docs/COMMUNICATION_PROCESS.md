- Implementation progress summary
- Major milestones completed
- Security and production readiness updates
- Community contribution highlights
- Upcoming priorities

### Quarterly Roadmap Reviews
**When**: First week of January, April, July, October  
**Format**: Updated PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md + GitHub Discussion  
**Content**:
- Comprehensive progress assessment
- Roadmap adjustments based on progress
- New priorities and focus areas

- New features and capabilities
- Security improvements
- Deprecation notices

## Documentation Maintenance

### Regular Review Cycle
- **Weekly**: Check for outdated information in key docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, STATUS)
- **Monthly**: Update implementation completion percentages
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive documentation audit and cleanup

### Documentation Responsibilities

#### Maintainers
- Review and approve all major documentation updates
- Ensure consistency across documentation
- Coordinate with RFC process for design decisions
- Maintain documentation quality standards

#### Contributors
- Update documentation for code changes
- Report outdated or incorrect documentation
- Suggest improvements to onboarding and guides
- Contribute examples and tutorials

### Key Documents and Update Frequency

| Document | Update Frequency | Responsibility | Trigger |
|----------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **README.md** | As needed | Maintainers | Major feature completions |
| **CONTRIBUTING.md** | Monthly | Maintainers | Process changes, status updates |
| **PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md** | Monthly | Maintainers | Progress milestones |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | With releases | Release manager | Version releases |
| **API Documentation** | With changes | Developers | API changes |
| **Architecture docs** | Quarterly | Maintainers | Architectural changes |

## RFC and Design Decision Process

### RFC Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Initial RFC creation and development
2. **Community Discussion**: GitHub issue for feedback (minimum 2 weeks)
3. **Technical Review**: Maintainer and expert review
4. **Final Comment Period**: Last call for feedback (1 week)
5. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request changes
6. **Implementation**: Accepted RFCs guide development

### Design Decision Communication
- All major design decisions documented in RFCs
- Implementation updates reference relevant RFCs
- Breaking changes require RFC approval
- Community input actively solicited and considered

## Community Communication Channels

### Primary Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, specific problems
- **GitHub Discussions**: Community discussion, questions, announcements  
- **GitHub Releases**: Version announcements and change summaries
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references

### Communication Guidelines
- **Transparency**: All major decisions and changes communicated publicly
- **Accessibility**: Documentation available in multiple formats
- **Responsiveness**: Issues and questions addressed promptly
- **Inclusivity**: Multiple communication channels accommodate different preferences

## Status Tracking and Metrics

### Progress Metrics
- **Implementation Completion**: Percentage completion by domain area
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage and test quality metrics
- **Security Readiness**: Security audit and hardening progress
- **Performance**: Benchmark results and optimization progress
- **Community Health**: Contributor activity and satisfaction

### Public Dashboards
- **Project Status Page**: Real-time implementation status
- **Security Status**: Current security posture and audit progress
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Latest performance test results
- **Community Metrics**: Contributor and user engagement statistics
