# RFC-001: Governance and Federated Scaling Architecture

- **RFC Number**: RFC-001
- **Title**: Governance and Federated Scaling Architecture
- **Author(s)**: ICN Core Community
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Created**: 2025-01-26
- **Updated**: 2025-01-26
- **Related Issues**: #942, #930, #931

## Summary

This RFC proposes a comprehensive framework for governance and federated scaling in ICN Core, establishing how local, federation, and global governance interact through literal social contracts implemented as CCL contracts.

## Motivation

ICN Core needs a clear, systematic approach to governance that:

1. **Scales from local to global**: Supports governance from individual cooperatives to global federations
2. **Maintains autonomy**: Preserves local decision-making while enabling coordination
3. **Enables transparency**: Provides auditable, versioned governance processes
4. **Supports diversity**: Allows different governance models within the same federation
5. **Enforces agreements**: Makes social contracts literal and enforceable

Key open questions from issues #930 and #931 include:
- How to aggregate votes across federation levels
- What should be in core protocol vs CCL contracts
- How to handle dispute resolution and enforcement
- How to maintain transparency and auditability

## Detailed Design

### Literal Social Contracts

Social contracts are versioned, enforceable CCL contracts that define:
- Rights and responsibilities at each governance level
- Resource flows and economic relationships  
- Governance procedures and voting mechanisms
- Dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms

#### Contract Registry
- **Canonical Log**: Append-only, public registry of all social contracts
- **Version Control**: Full history of amendments, ratifications, and forks
- **Scope Hierarchy**: Local → Federation → Global contract relationships
- **Inheritance Rules**: How local contracts inherit from federation/global templates

### Federated Voting Architecture

#### Local Level
- **Autonomy**: Each co-op/community uses preferred governance model
- **CCL Implementation**: Governance rules defined in CCL contracts
- **Model Flexibility**: Direct, delegated, quadratic, reputation-weighted, etc.
- **Local Sovereignty**: Final authority over local matters

#### Federation Level
- **Aggregation Functions**: Pluggable mechanisms for scaling local votes
  - Proportional representation (by population/membership)
  - Quadratic scaling (to prevent plutocracy)
  - One-group-one-vote (equal representation)
  - Reputation-weighted aggregation
  - Hybrid models with multiple factors
- **Transparency**: All aggregation methods public and auditable
- **Customization**: Federations choose their aggregation rules

#### Global Level
- **Inter-Federation Coordination**: Federations participate in global governance
- **Weight Determination**: Transparent algorithms for federation influence
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Supermajority, consent-based, or threshold models
- **Scaling Functions**: Prevent domination by size or economic power

### Implementation Considerations

#### DAG Layer Requirements
- **Contract Storage**: All social contracts stored as DAG objects
- **Version Tracking**: Full amendment and fork history
- **Multi-Parent Support**: Complex event aggregation (federated votes, parallel disputes)
- **Global Auditability**: Complete audit trails across all governance levels

#### ZK Privacy Features
- **Anonymous Voting**: Privacy-preserving vote casting where desired
- **Selective Disclosure**: Controlled revelation of governance participation
- **Sybil Resistance**: Proof-of-personhood without identity exposure
- **Confidential Proposals**: Private deliberation with public decisions

#### CCL Contract Hooks
- **Governance Models**: Pluggable voting and decision-making mechanisms
- **Aggregation Rules**: Customizable federation-level vote scaling
- **Dispute Resolution**: Modular arbitration and mediation systems
- **Amendment Procedures**: Standardized contract upgrade mechanisms

#### Core Protocol Support
- **Identity**: Secure, privacy-respecting authentication across levels
- **Voting Engine**: Primitives for proposal, voting, and tallying
- **Cross-Federation Messaging**: Secure communication for governance
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for governance functions

### Impact on Existing Code

This RFC primarily adds new functionality rather than changing existing systems:

- **icn-governance**: Enhanced with federation aggregation capabilities
- **icn-ccl**: Extended with governance contract templates and hooks
- **icn-identity**: Enhanced with cross-federation identity management
- **icn-dag**: Support for governance object types and version tracking

## Drawbacks

1. **Complexity**: Multi-level governance increases system complexity
2. **Performance**: Vote aggregation across large federations may be slow
3. **Governance Overhead**: More complex governance may reduce participation
4. **Technical Barriers**: Requires understanding of CCL for governance customization

## Rationale and Alternatives

### Why This Design?

1. **Preserves Autonomy**: Local groups maintain sovereignty while enabling coordination
2. **Enables Experimentation**: Different governance models can coexist and evolve
3. **Scales Naturally**: Architecture supports growth from small groups to global networks
4. **Provides Transparency**: All governance processes are auditable and accountable

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Single Global Governance**: Too centralized, reduces local autonomy
2. **Pure Local Governance**: Insufficient for federation coordination
3. **Fixed Voting Models**: Reduces flexibility and innovation in governance
4. **Off-Chain Governance**: Reduces transparency and enforceability

## Prior Art

- **Ethereum Governance**: On-chain voting with delegation
- **Polkadot Council**: Multi-tier governance with technical committee
- **Colony Network**: Reputation-based governance and dispute resolution
- **Decidim**: Participatory democracy platform with multiple levels
- **Liquid Democracy**: Delegative voting systems

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Performance Optimization**: How to optimize vote aggregation for large federations?
2. **Economic Incentives**: What incentives ensure participation in federation governance?
3. **Dispute Escalation**: How should local disputes escalate to federation/global levels?
4. **Cross-Federation Standards**: What governance standards should be enforced globally?
5. **Emergency Procedures**: How to handle urgent decisions that bypass normal governance?

## Future Possibilities

1. **AI-Assisted Governance**: Machine learning for proposal analysis and impact prediction
2. **Cross-Chain Governance**: Governance coordination with external blockchain networks  
3. **Predictive Governance**: Simulation tools for testing governance proposals
4. **Adaptive Governance**: Self-modifying governance systems based on outcomes
5. **Global Commons Management**: Planetary-scale resource governance mechanisms
