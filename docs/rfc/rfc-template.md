## Summary

[Brief explanation of the feature or design being proposed]

## Motivation

[Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?]

## Detailed Design

[This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with ICN Core to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.]

### Implementation Considerations

[Specific technical considerations for implementation]

### Impact on Existing Code

[How will this change affect existing implementations?]

## Drawbacks

[Why should we not do this?]

## Rationale and Alternatives

[Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs? What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?]

## Prior Art

[Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. This can include existing implementations in ICN Core, implementations in other projects, academic research, etc.]

## Unresolved Questions

[What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged? What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?]

## Future Possibilities

[Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect ICN Core as a whole. This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.]
