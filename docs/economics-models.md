# ICN Economic Models

> **Beyond Capitalism: Designing Economies for Human Flourishing**

The InterCooperative Network (ICN) implements anti-capitalist economic models that prioritize collective benefit, resource sharing, and human dignity over profit maximization and capital accumulation. This document outlines the comprehensive economic system and its mechanisms.

---

## 🎯 **Core Economic Principles**

### **Anti-Capitalist Design**
- **No Speculation**: Economic tokens cannot be abstracted or used for financial speculation
- **Purpose-Bound Value**: All value tokens are scoped to specific capabilities and uses
- **Collective Ownership**: Resources and tools are shared rather than privately owned
- **Mutual Aid**: Economic flows support community needs and solidarity

### **Regenerative Economics**
- **Abundance Mindset**: Design for sufficiency rather than artificial scarcity
- **Ecological Integration**: Economic activity supports rather than degrades ecosystems
- **Social Reproduction**: Value care work and community maintenance
- **Circular Flows**: Resources circulate rather than being extracted and discarded

### **Democratic Control**
- **Participatory Budgeting**: Communities decide resource allocation democratically
- **Worker Ownership**: Those who create value control economic decisions
- **Transparent Operations**: All economic activity is visible and accountable
- **Equitable Distribution**: Benefits flow to all contributors, not just capital owners

---

## 💰 **Core Economic Mechanisms**

### **1. Mana System (Regenerating Resource Credits)**

Mana is ICN's primary coordination mechanism for compute resources and network participation. Unlike traditional currencies, mana cannot be accumulated indefinitely or used for speculation.

#### **Key Properties**
- **Regenerative**: Automatically replenishes over time
- **Non-Transferable**: Cannot be sold or traded (except under specific governance rules)
- **Purpose-Bound**: Only usable for compute and network participation
- **Reputation-Influenced**: Regeneration rate affected by contribution history

#### **Mana Mechanics**
```rust
pub struct ManaAccount {
    pub did: Did,
    pub current_balance: u64,
    pub max_capacity: u64,
    pub regeneration_rate: f64,
    pub last_regeneration: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub reputation_multiplier: f64,
}

impl ManaAccount {
    pub fn regenerate(&mut self, now: DateTime<Utc>) {
        let time_elapsed = now.signed_duration_since(self.last_regeneration);
        let hours_elapsed = time_elapsed.num_hours() as f64;
        
        let regeneration = (self.regeneration_rate * hours_elapsed * self.reputation_multiplier) as u64;
        self.current_balance = std::cmp::min(
            self.current_balance + regeneration,
            self.max_capacity
        );
        self.last_regeneration = now;
    }
}
```

#### **Mana Use Cases**
- **Mesh Computing**: Pay for distributed computation jobs
- **Network Participation**: Cover costs of P2P networking
- **Storage Access**: Use decentralized storage services
- **Governance Participation**: Vote on proposals and decisions
- **Identity Operations**: Manage DIDs and credentials

### **2. Scoped Token Framework**

ICN supports purpose-bound tokens that represent specific capabilities or resources within the network. These tokens cannot be abstracted into generic currency.

#### **Token Types**
```rust
pub enum ScopedTokenType {
    Compute(ComputeSpecification),
    Storage(StorageSpecification),
    Bandwidth(BandwidthSpecification),
    Service(ServiceSpecification),
    Resource(ResourceSpecification),
}

pub struct ScopedToken {
    pub token_type: ScopedTokenType,
    pub issuer: Did,
    pub holder: Did,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub expiry: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub conditions: Vec<UsageCondition>,
    pub non_transferable: bool,
}
```

#### **Example Token Types**
- **`icn:compute/cpu-hours`**: CPU computation time
- **`icn:storage/gigabyte-months`**: Persistent storage space
- **`icn:bandwidth/gigabytes`**: Network data transfer
- **`icn:service/translation`**: Language translation services
- **`icn:resource/meeting-room`**: Physical space booking

### **3. Contribution Recognition System**

ICN recognizes multiple forms of contribution beyond just financial investment, ensuring that all types of valuable work are acknowledged and rewarded.

#### **Contribution Categories**
```rust
pub enum ContributionType {
    Labor {
        skill_level: SkillLevel,
        hours: f64,
        quality_rating: f64,
    },
    Knowledge {
        domain: String,
        impact_score: f64,
        peer_validation: bool,
    },
    Care {
        care_type: CareType,
        recipients: Vec<Did>,
        community_impact: f64,
    },
    Resources {
        resource_type: ResourceType,
        value: u64,
        duration: Duration,
    },
    Innovation {
        innovation_type: InnovationType,
        adoption_rate: f64,
        improvement_measure: f64,
    },
}
```

#### **Recognition Mechanisms**
- **Peer Recognition**: Community members acknowledge each other's contributions
- **Outcome Tracking**: Measure impact and results of contributions
- **Skill Development**: Support for learning and capability building
- **Mentorship Programs**: Experienced members guide newcomers

## 🌐 **Federated Economic Coordination**

### **Inter-Cooperative Trade**

Cooperatives can establish economic relationships while maintaining their autonomy and values alignment.

#### **Trust Networks**
```ccl
fn establish_trade_relationship(
    cooperative_a: Did,
    cooperative_b: Did,
    trade_terms: TradeTerms
) -> TradeAgreement {
    // Verify values alignment
    let values_compatible = check_values_alignment(cooperative_a, cooperative_b);
    if !values_compatible {
        return TradeAgreement::Rejected("Values misalignment");
    }
    
    // Assess economic compatibility
    let economic_compatibility = assess_economic_models(cooperative_a, cooperative_b);
    if economic_compatibility < 0.7 {
        return TradeAgreement::RequiresMediation;
    }
    
    // Create mutual agreement
    let agreement = TradeAgreement {
        parties: [cooperative_a, cooperative_b],
        terms: trade_terms,
        monitoring: create_monitoring_framework(),
        dispute_resolution: create_dispute_process(),
    };
    
    return TradeAgreement::Approved(agreement);
}
```

#### **Resource Sharing Protocols**
- **Surplus Distribution**: Share excess capacity across cooperatives
- **Mutual Aid Networks**: Support cooperatives during difficulties
- **Skill Exchange**: Share expertise and knowledge across organizations
- **Equipment Sharing**: Pool expensive tools and infrastructure

### **Federation Economic Governance**

Federations coordinate economic policy across multiple cooperatives while respecting local autonomy.

#### **Federated Budgeting**
```ccl
fn allocate_federation_resources(
    budget: FederationBudget,
    proposals: Vec<ResourceRequest>
) -> AllocationResult {
    let scored_proposals = proposals
        .map(|p| score_proposal(p))
        .sort_by_score();
    
    let democratic_weights = get_member_preferences();
    let expert_recommendations = get_expert_analysis();
    let impact_assessments = get_impact_projections();
    
    let final_allocation = optimize_allocation(
        scored_proposals,
        democratic_weights,
        expert_recommendations,
        impact_assessments
    );
    
    return AllocationResult::Approved(final_allocation);
}
```

## 📊 **Economic Metrics & Indicators**

### **Beyond GDP: Measuring What Matters**

ICN tracks economic indicators that reflect actual human and ecological wellbeing rather than just monetary flows.

#### **Wellbeing Indicators**
- **Basic Needs Security**: Access to housing, food, healthcare, education
- **Community Resilience**: Ability to respond to challenges and shocks
- **Ecological Health**: Environmental impact and regeneration measures
- **Social Cohesion**: Quality of relationships and mutual support
- **Creative Expression**: Opportunities for art, culture, and innovation

#### **Economic Health Metrics**
```rust
pub struct EconomicHealthIndicators {
    pub resource_abundance_ratio: f64,    // Available resources / needed resources
    pub contribution_diversity_index: f64, // Variety of recognized contributions
    pub economic_democracy_score: f64,     // Participation in economic decisions
    pub mutual_aid_flow_rate: f64,        // Rate of solidarity economy activity
    pub ecological_impact_score: f64,      // Environmental sustainability measure
}
```

### **Inequality Prevention**

ICN includes mechanisms to prevent the concentration of wealth and power that characterizes capitalist systems.

#### **Wealth Distribution Monitoring**
```ccl
fn monitor_wealth_concentration(community: Community) -> ConcentrationReport {
    let wealth_distribution = calculate_wealth_distribution(community);
    let gini_coefficient = calculate_gini(wealth_distribution);
    
    if gini_coefficient > 0.3 {
        trigger_redistribution_mechanisms(community);
    }
    
    let concentration_report = ConcentrationReport {
        gini_coefficient,
        wealth_percentiles: wealth_distribution,
        recommended_actions: get_redistribution_recommendations(),
    };
    
    return concentration_report;
}
```

#### **Anti-Accumulation Mechanisms**
- **Maximum Wealth Ratios**: Limits on individual vs. community wealth
- **Use-It-Or-Lose-It**: Resources that aren't actively used return to the commons
- **Progressive Contribution**: Higher expectations for those with more resources
- **Rotational Leadership**: Prevent permanent concentration of decision-making power

## 🔄 **Economic Lifecycle Management**

### **Resource Lifecycle Tracking**

ICN tracks resources through their entire lifecycle to optimize use and minimize waste.

#### **Lifecycle Stages**
```rust
pub enum ResourceLifecycleStage {
    Planning {
        needs_assessment: NeedsAssessment,
        resource_design: ResourceDesign,
    },
    Acquisition {
        sourcing_method: SourcingMethod,
        cost_accounting: CostAccounting,
    },
    Production {
        transformation_process: ProductionProcess,
        quality_metrics: QualityMetrics,
    },
    Distribution {
        allocation_mechanism: AllocationMechanism,
        access_criteria: AccessCriteria,
    },
    Usage {
        utilization_tracking: UtilizationMetrics,
        user_feedback: UserFeedback,
    },
    Maintenance {
        maintenance_schedule: MaintenanceSchedule,
        repair_history: RepairHistory,
    },
    EndOfLife {
        disposal_method: DisposalMethod,
        recovery_potential: RecoveryPotential,
    },
}
```

### **Circular Economy Patterns**

Resources flow in cycles rather than linear consumption patterns.

#### **Sharing Economy**
- **Tool Libraries**: Shared access to equipment and tools
- **Skill Sharing**: Exchange knowledge and capabilities
- **Space Sharing**: Optimize use of physical infrastructure
- **Time Banking**: Exchange time and labor directly

#### **Repair and Reuse**
- **Repair Cafes**: Community spaces for fixing and maintaining items

- **Component Recovery**: Harvest useful parts from end-of-life items
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Document repair and maintenance procedures

---

## 🌱 **Regenerative Economic Practices**

### **Ecological Integration**

Economic activity is designed to support rather than degrade ecological systems.

#### **Ecological Accounting**
```ccl
fn calculate_ecological_impact(activity: EconomicActivity) -> EcologicalImpact {
    let carbon_footprint = calculate_carbon_emissions(activity);
    let resource_depletion = calculate_resource_usage(activity);
    let biodiversity_impact = calculate_biodiversity_effect(activity);
    let pollution_generation = calculate_pollution_output(activity);
    
    let regenerative_benefits = calculate_regenerative_activities(activity);
    
    let net_impact = EcologicalImpact {
        carbon_balance: regenerative_benefits.carbon_sequestration - carbon_footprint,
        resource_balance: regenerative_benefits.resource_generation - resource_depletion,
        biodiversity_balance: regenerative_benefits.habitat_creation - biodiversity_impact,
        pollution_balance: regenerative_benefits.cleanup_activity - pollution_generation,
    };
    
    return net_impact;
}
```

### **Care Economy Integration**

ICN recognizes and supports care work as essential economic activity.

#### **Care Work Recognition**
- **Childcare**: Supporting the next generation
- **Elder Care**: Honoring and supporting older community members
- **Health Support**: Physical and mental health maintenance
- **Emotional Labor**: Community relationships and conflict resolution
- **Education**: Knowledge sharing and skill development

#### **Care Economy Metrics**
```rust
pub struct CareEconomyIndicators {
    pub care_workload_distribution: HashMap<Did, f64>,
    pub care_quality_metrics: CareQualityMetrics,
    pub care_infrastructure_investment: u64,
    pub care_worker_support_level: f64,
    pub community_wellbeing_index: f64,
}
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Tools**

### **Economic Policy Templates**

ICN provides templates for common economic governance needs.

#### **Resource Allocation Policies**
```ccl
// Democratic budgeting template
fn democratic_budget_allocation(
    budget: Budget,
    proposals: Vec<BudgetProposal>,
    members: Vec<Did>
) -> BudgetAllocation {
    let voting_results = conduct_budget_vote(proposals, members);
    let expert_analysis = get_expert_recommendations(proposals);
    let impact_assessment = assess_community_impact(proposals);
    
    let final_allocation = combine_democratic_expert_input(
        voting_results,
        expert_analysis,
        impact_assessment
    );
    
    return BudgetAllocation::Approved(final_allocation);
}
```

#### **Contribution Recognition Policies**
```ccl
// Multi-factor contribution assessment
fn assess_contribution_value(contribution: Contribution) -> ContributionValue {
    let time_investment = contribution.hours_spent;
    let skill_level = assess_skill_requirement(contribution);
    let quality_rating = get_peer_quality_assessment(contribution);
    let community_impact = measure_community_benefit(contribution);
    
    let base_value = time_investment * skill_level;
    let quality_multiplier = 0.5 + (quality_rating * 1.5);
    let impact_multiplier = 0.8 + (community_impact * 0.4);
    
    let total_value = base_value * quality_multiplier * impact_multiplier;
    
    return ContributionValue {
        base_value,
        quality_adjusted: total_value,
        recognition_tokens: calculate_recognition_tokens(total_value),
        reputation_impact: calculate_reputation_effect(total_value),
    };
}
