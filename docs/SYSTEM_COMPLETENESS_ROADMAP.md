# ICN System Completeness Roadmap

This document outlines the remaining gaps and development priorities for completing the InterCooperative Network (ICN) system. Based on the current architecture and implemented features, this roadmap identifies what's needed to transform ICN from a functional MVP into a complete cooperative digital infrastructure platform.

## Current Status

The ICN Core provides a solid foundation with:
- ✅ Core runtime and mesh job execution
- ✅ DID-based identity and basic credential system
- ✅ Mana economics and governance framework
- ✅ DAG-based receipt anchoring
- ✅ Network p2p communication
- ✅ Basic API and CLI interfaces
- ✅ Zero-knowledge proof circuits (basic implementation)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Critical System Gaps (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Zero-Knowledge Credential Disclosure
**Status**: Partially stubbed  
**Impact**: Essential for privacy-preserving cooperative membership

**Missing Components**:
- Working `ZkCredentialProof` plumbing through `icn-identity`, `icn-api`, and `icn-runtime`
- ZK proof verification endpoints (`/credentials/verify_zk`) not yet exposed
- No user tooling to generate selective proofs from issued credentials

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Finalize circuit trait interface (age, reputation, membership)
- [ ] Expose ZK credential endpoints in `icn-api`
- [ ] Integrate with identity resolution flow in `icn-runtime`
- [ ] Add ZK credential commands to `icn-cli`

#### 1.2 Scoped Token Economy
**Status**: Partially implemented  
**Impact**: Core to cooperative resource sharing

**Missing Components**:
- On-chain issuance, redemption, and transfer logic for scoped tokens (`compute.credit`, `local.food.token`)
- Governance-controlled token policy updates
- No scoped token indexing or explorer support

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Extend `icn-economics` with scoped token ledger
- [ ] Add `TransferTokenRequest` and related endpoints
- [ ] Build scoped accounting view per DID
- [ ] Create token policy governance integration

#### 1.3 Federation Sync Protocol Hardening
**Status**: Functional but not hardened  
**Impact**: Essential for multi-node federation reliability

**Missing Components**:
- Formal conflict resolution rules for DAG forks or duplicate proposals

**Impact**: Enables truly programmable cooperative governance

**Missing Components**:
- Fully dynamic policy interpretation for runtime behavior

- [ ] Add runtime policy update mechanisms
- [ ] Create governance policy testing framework

#### 2.2 Advanced Mesh Job Orchestration
**Status**: MVP working  
**Impact**: Improves efficiency of cooperative compute sharing

**Missing Components**:

- Job cost prediction/estimation from history
- Multi-job batch execution with grouped resource allocation

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Extend scoring algorithm to include time/capacity hints
- [ ] Add executor job queue introspection API
- [ ] Allow CCL contracts to submit batch jobs with dependencies

#### 2.3 Credential Lifecycle Tooling
**Status**: Partially built  
**Impact**: Essential for cooperative membership management

**Missing Components**:
- No CLI command for issuing/verifying ZK credentials
- No governance-issued credentials (`federation.member`, `coop.worker`)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Extend `icn-cli` and `icn-api` to support credential flows
- [ ] Create CCL contract to issue credentials on proposal pass
- [ ] Add federation membership proof template
- [ ] Build credential revocation system

### Phase 3: User Experience & Tooling (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Web UI / Wallet / Explorer Suite
**Status**: Not in repo yet  
**Impact**: Critical for user adoption and accessibility

**Missing Components**:
- ICN Wallet (DID/key/credential manager)
- ICN Web Dashboard (governance/vote/job view)
- ICN DAG Explorer (view receipts, trace proposals, audit actions)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Kickstart wallet as a WASM/PWA app
- [ ] Create TypeScript SDK using `icn-api` crate
- [ ] Design read-only DAG explorer view
- [ ] Build governance participation dashboard
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive interfaces

#### 3.2 Economic Flows and Ledger Visibility
**Status**: Functional, not fully transparent  
**Impact**: Enables cooperative financial transparency

**Missing Components**:
- No aggregated view of mana inflows/outflows per account
- No ledger of scoped token activity
- No inflation/decay model for economic simulation

**Action Items**:
- [x] Build `icn-economics` ledger explorer
- [x] Add hooks to store mana transaction summaries to DAG
- [ ] Create dashboard panels for cooperative treasury visualization
- [x] Implement economic simulation tools

#### 3.3 Federation Bootstrap CLI/UX
**Status**: Missing  
**Impact**: Critical for cooperative formation and growth

**Missing Components**:
- No "create federation" or "add node to federation" guided flows
- No cross-node federation parameter templates

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add `icn-cli federation init` command
- [ ] Add `icn-cli federation join` command  
- [ ] Add `icn-cli federation sync` command
- [ ] Create federation setup wizard
- [ ] Build federation health monitoring tools

### Phase 4: Cooperative-Specific Features (Lower Priority)
