## 🚀 Major Achievements

### **1. Mesh Network Service Production Upgrade**
- **Replaced** `StubMeshNetworkService` with `DefaultMeshNetworkService` when libp2p is enabled
- **Enables** true cross-federation mesh computing capabilities
- **Supports** real job announcements, bid collection, and governance propagation across federation nodes
- **Unlocks** scalability beyond the current 3-node development federation

### **2. Cryptographic Security Enhancement**
- **Implemented** `DefaultSigner` with production-grade Ed25519 cryptography
- **Enhanced** error handling, validation, and DID integration
- **Added** cryptographic consistency validation and audit logging
- **Replaced** basic StubSigner with enterprise-grade security

### **3. Persistent DAG Storage Implementation**
- **Enhanced** DAG storage selection with comprehensive persistence options
- **Prioritizes** RocksDB, SQLite, and Sled for production deployments
- **Provides** clear logging and graceful fallback to StubDagStore for development
- **Ensures** data integrity and tamper-evident history storage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Before: Phase 4 Development State**
```rust
// All services used stub implementations
mesh_network_service: Arc::new(StubMeshNetworkService::new()),
signer: Arc::new(StubSigner::new()),
dag_store: Arc::new(TokioMutex::new(StubDagStore::new())),
```

### **After: Phase 5 Production State**
```rust
// Production services with intelligent selection
#[cfg(feature = "enable-libp2p")]
let mesh_network_service = Arc::new(DefaultMeshNetworkService::new(libp2p_service));

let signer = Arc::new(DefaultSigner::new_for_did(&current_identity)?);

#[cfg(feature = "persist-rocksdb")]
let dag_store = Arc::new(TokioMutex::new(RocksdbDagStore::new(path)?));
```
