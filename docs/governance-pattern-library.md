# Governance Pattern Library

The `icn-templates` crate collects reusable CCL snippets for common cooperative bylaws. Contracts in this library can be compiled as-is or customized for local needs.

## Available Patterns

- `simple_voting.ccl`
- `treasury_rules.ccl`
- `rotating_stewards.ccl`
- `rotating_council.ccl`
- `rotating_assembly.ccl`

Each constant is exported from `icn-templates` for programmatic access. The same files are available under [`icn-ccl/examples/`](../icn-ccl/examples/) for quick inspection.

Use these patterns with the formation wizard or your own tooling to bootstrap new cooperatives.
