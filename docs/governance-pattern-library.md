# Governance Pattern Library

This page catalogs reusable governance structures implemented in CCL. Each pattern links to an example contract in `icn-ccl/examples/`.

## Patterns

### Rotating Stewards
- **File:** `rotating_stewards_template.ccl`
- **Use:** Rotate stewardship duties on a fixed schedule.

### Council Majority
- **File:** `council_template.ccl`
- **Use:** Approve proposals with a simple majority of council votes.

### Member Assembly Quorum
- **File:** `assembly_template.ccl`
- **Use:** Verify quorum participation before accepting assembly decisions.

Contributions of additional patterns are welcome. Refer to these templates when composing new governance policies.
