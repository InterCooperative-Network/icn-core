# Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration

> **⚠️ Development Status**: Zero-knowledge workflows are prototype quality. Use in test environments only.

ICN Core integrates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving authentication and data validation.

## Proof Flow

1. A proving client generates a proof using the circuits in `crates/icn-zk/`.
2. The proof is submitted to the runtime for verification.
3. Verified proofs grant access or validate transactions without revealing sensitive data.

## Security Considerations

* Audit circuits carefully for side-channel leaks.
* Ensure trusted setup parameters are distributed securely.
* Monitor verification costs to prevent denial-of-service vectors.

Production deployment will require extensive security review and benchmarking.
