# ICN RFCs (Requests for Comments)

This directory contains Requests for Comments (RFCs) for the InterCooperative Network (ICN).
These documents describe proposed changes, new features, standards, or information related to the ICN.

## Process

The ICN RFC flow uses regular GitHub issues and pull requests. Follow these steps
to submit, review, and accept an RFC:

1. **Open an issue** – Create an issue in this repository using the RFC template
   (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc.md`). Describe your proposal and gather initial
   feedback.
2. **Draft the RFC** – Once the idea is ready for formal review, open a pull
   request that adds a new file in this directory. Name the file
   `####-your-title.md`, where `####` is the next available four-digit number.
   Use the same number in the RFC header and add a link to it in this README.
3. **Review** – Maintainers and the community discuss the pull request. Update
   the text until consensus is reached.
4. **Acceptance** – After approval, the pull request is merged and the RFC’s
   status changes to *Accepted*. The assigned number becomes official.

Issues and pull requests for RFCs are filed in the `icn-core` repository. RFC
numbers are allocated sequentially as pull requests are merged.
