# Trust Verification & Attestation System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses the requirements from the problem statement for **Trust Verification & Attestation System** by adding comprehensive multi-party trust attestation capabilities to the ICN core identity system.

## Requirements Addressed

### ✅ 2.3.1: Multi-Party Trust Attestations
- **Implementation**: `TrustAttestation` struct with cryptographic signatures
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple cooperatives can vouch for trust relationships
  - Each attestation is cryptographically signed by the attester
  - Attestations include trust level, context, evidence, and timestamps
  - Verification system ensures authenticity of attestations

### ✅ 2.3.2: Reputation-Based Trust Weighting
- **Implementation**: `MultiPartyTrustRecord::calculate_aggregated_score()` 
- **Key Features**:
  - Higher reputation cooperatives have more influence
  - Weighted aggregation based on attester reputation
  - Configurable minimum reputation thresholds
  - Fallback to simple averaging when reputation system unavailable

### ✅ 2.3.3: Trust Challenge & Dispute Resolution
- **Implementation**: `TrustChallenge` system integrated with governance
- **Key Features**:
  - Challenge creation with evidence and reasoning
  - Challenge status tracking (Pending, UnderReview, Accepted, Rejected, Withdrawn)
  - Integration points for governance proposal creation
  - Dispute resolution tracking and audit trails

### ✅ 2.3.4: Trust Audit Trails
- **Implementation**: `TrustAuditEvent` with DAG anchoring
- **Key Features**:
  - Immutable records of all trust changes
  - DAG anchoring for tamper-evident history
  - Comprehensive event types (attestation created/updated/revoked, challenges, resolutions)
  - Full audit trail retrieval capabilities

## Key Components

### Core Data Structures

1. **`TrustAttestation`** - Individual trust attestation with signature
   ```rust
   pub struct TrustAttestation {
       pub attester: Did,
       pub subject: Did, 
       pub context: TrustContext,
       pub trust_level: TrustLevel,
       pub timestamp: u64,
       pub evidence: Option<String>,
       pub signature: Vec<u8>,
   }
   ```

2. **`MultiPartyTrustRecord`** - Aggregated multi-party attestations
   ```rust
   pub struct MultiPartyTrustRecord {
       pub subject: Did,
       pub context: TrustContext,
       pub attestations: Vec<TrustAttestation>,
       pub aggregated_score: f64,
       pub last_updated: u64,
       pub dag_cid: Option<Cid>,
   }
   ```

3. **`TrustChallenge`** - Challenge/dispute mechanism
   ```rust
   pub struct TrustChallenge {
       pub challenge_id: String,
       pub challenger: Did,
       pub challenged_subject: Did,
       pub context: TrustContext,
       pub reason: String,
       pub evidence: Option<String>,
       pub timestamp: u64,
       pub status: ChallengeStatus,
       pub dag_cid: Option<Cid>,
   }
   ```

4. **`TrustAuditEvent`** - Audit trail entries
   ```rust
   pub struct TrustAuditEvent {
       pub event_id: String,
       pub event_type: TrustEventType,
       pub actor: Did,
       pub subject: Did,
       pub context: TrustContext,
       pub timestamp: u64,
       pub data: serde_json::Value,
       pub dag_cid: Option<Cid>,
   }
   ```

### Storage and Management

- **`TrustAttestationStore`** trait with `InMemoryTrustAttestationStore` implementation
- Persistent storage interfaces for trust records, challenges, and audit events
- Integration with existing DAG storage for immutable anchoring

### Verification Engine

- **`TrustVerificationEngine`** - Main coordination component
- Integrates with reputation system for weighted scoring
- Provides audit trail anchoring in DAG
- Configurable thresholds and policies

## Integration Points

### With Existing ICN Systems

1. **Identity System** (`icn-identity`)
   - Extends existing DID and signature verification
   - Uses existing key management and resolution

2. **DAG Storage** (`icn-dag`)
   - Anchors audit events for immutable history
   - Stores trust verification records

3. **Reputation System** (`icn-reputation`)
   - Weights attestations by attester reputation
   - Enforces minimum reputation thresholds

4. **Governance System** (`icn-governance`)
   - Challenge resolution through governance proposals
   - Dispute resolution tracking

## Security Features

1. **Cryptographic Integrity**
   - All attestations cryptographically signed
   - Signature verification for each attestation
   - DID-based identity verification

2. **Tamper Evidence**
   - DAG anchoring for immutable audit trails
   - Content-addressed storage prevents modification
   - Complete history preservation

3. **Reputation-Based Security**
   - Minimum reputation requirements for attesters
   - Weighted influence based on historical behavior
   - Sybil resistance through reputation requirements

4. **Challenge Mechanisms**
   - Public challenge system for disputed trust
   - Evidence-based dispute resolution
   - Governance integration for fair resolution

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Verifying Trust Attestations

```rust
// Create attestation
let attestation = TrustAttestation::new(
    attester_did,
    subject_did,
    TrustContext::General,
    TrustLevel::Full,
    current_timestamp,
    Some("Evidence of good behavior".into()),
);

// Sign attestation
let signed = attestation.sign_with_key(&signing_key)?;

// Verify attestation
signed.verify_with_resolver(&did_resolver)?;
```

### Managing Multi-Party Trust Records

```rust
// Create trust record
let mut record = MultiPartyTrustRecord::new(subject_did, TrustContext::General);

// Add multiple attestations
record.add_attestation(attestation1, timestamp)?;
record.add_attestation(attestation2, timestamp)?;

// Calculate weighted score
let score = record.calculate_aggregated_score(&reputation_store);
```

### Trust Challenge System

```rust
// Submit challenge
let challenge_id = engine.submit_challenge(
    challenger_did,
    challenged_subject,
    TrustContext::General,
    "Reason for challenge".into(),
    Some("Supporting evidence".into()),
)?;

// Resolve challenge
engine.resolve_challenge(
    &challenge_id,
    ChallengeResolution::Accept,
    resolver_did,
)?;
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- Attestation creation, signing, and verification
- Multi-party record management
- Trust challenge workflows
