//! # ICN CLI Crate
//! This crate provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the InterCooperative Network (ICN).
//! It allows users and administrators to manage nodes, interact with the network, and perform administrative tasks.
//! The CLI aims for usability, discoverability, and scriptability.

    println!("Hello, world!");
