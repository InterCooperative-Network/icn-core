# ICN Mesh Crate

This crate focuses on job orchestration, scheduling, and execution within the InterCooperative Network (ICN) mesh network.

## Purpose

The `icn-mesh` crate is responsible for:

*   **Job Definition:** Defining how tasks or jobs are described and submitted to the mesh network.
*   **Resource Discovery:** Finding nodes within the mesh that have the capacity and capabilities to execute specific jobs.
*   **Scheduling:** Assigning jobs to appropriate nodes based on factors like load, locality, or specific requirements.
*   **Execution Management:** Overseeing the lifecycle of jobs, including starting, monitoring, and handling failures or results.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Ensuring that jobs can be completed reliably even if some nodes in the mesh fail or become unavailable.

This crate enables distributed computation and service execution across the ICN.

## Public API Style

The API style emphasizes:

*   **Reliability:** Robust job execution and fault handling.
*   **Scalability:** Ability to manage a large number of jobs and nodes.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimal use of network resources for job execution.
*   **Extensibility:** Allowing different types of jobs and scheduling algorithms to be supported.
