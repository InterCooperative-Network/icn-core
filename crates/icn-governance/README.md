# ICN Governance Crate

This crate defines the mechanisms for network governance within the InterCooperative Network (ICN).

## Purpose

The `icn-governance` crate is responsible for:

*   **Proposal Systems:** Defining how proposals for network changes (e.g., protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, funding) are submitted and managed.
*   **Voting Procedures:** Implementing the logic for how stakeholders vote on proposals, including vote counting and threshold determination.
*   **Quorum Logic:** Defining the requirements for a vote to be considered valid (e.g., minimum participation).
*   **Decision Execution:** Potentially interfacing with other crates to enact decisions once they are approved through governance.
*   **Role Management:** Managing roles and permissions related to governance participation.

This crate is essential for the decentralized control and evolution of the ICN.

## Public API Style

The API style emphasizes:

*   **Transparency:** Clear and auditable governance processes.
*   **Fairness:** Ensuring that voting and proposal mechanisms are equitable.
*   **Flexibility:** Allowing for different governance models or parameters to be configured.
*   **Interoperability:** Providing clear interfaces for other crates (e.g., `icn-cli`, `icn-node`) to interact with governance functions.
