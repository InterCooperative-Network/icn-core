# ICN Identity Crate

This crate manages decentralized identities (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and cryptographic operations for users and nodes within the InterCooperative Network (ICN).

See [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md) for ICN Core design philosophy and crate roles.
See [docs/ASYNC_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/ASYNC_OVERVIEW.md) for async API guidelines.

## Purpose

The `icn-identity` crate is responsible for:

*   **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Generating, resolving, and managing DIDs according to relevant specifications (e.g., W3C DID Core).
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Issuing, verifying, and managing VCs for attestations and authorizations within the network.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:** Providing and managing cryptographic keys, signatures, and encryption/decryption services necessary for identity and secure communication.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Defining mechanisms for proving identity and controlling access to resources or actions.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Utilities for proving credential properties without revealing the underlying data. The `Groth16Verifier` validates proofs generated by circuits in the `icn-zk` crate.

This crate is fundamental for establishing trust and security within the ICN.

## Public API Style

The API style emphasizes:

*   **Security:** Strong cryptographic practices and resistance to identity-related attacks.
*   **Interoperability:** Adherence to established standards for DIDs and VCs to ensure compatibility with other systems.
*   **Usability:** Clear interfaces for managing identities and credentials.

## DID Methods

* **`did:key`** – deterministic key-based identifiers with helper functions for
  creation and resolving to verifying keys.
* **`did:web`** – identifiers served from standard `did.json` documents. The
  [`WebDidResolver`] can fetch these documents over HTTPS at runtime to obtain
  the public key.
* **`did:peer`** – basic support for [algorithm 0](https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/).
  Keys can be encoded with [`did_peer_from_verifying_key`] and resolved with
  [`verifying_key_from_did_peer`].

### `did:web` segment validation

`did_web_from_parts` returns an error if any domain label or path segment
contains characters other than ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`, or `.` or if a
segment exceeds 63 characters. Domains longer than 253 characters are also
rejected.
