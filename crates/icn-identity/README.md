# ICN Identity Crate

This crate manages decentralized identities (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and cryptographic operations for users and nodes within the InterCooperative Network (ICN).

## Purpose

The `icn-identity` crate is responsible for:

*   **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Generating, resolving, and managing DIDs according to relevant specifications (e.g., W3C DID Core).
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Issuing, verifying, and managing VCs for attestations and authorizations within the network.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:** Providing and managing cryptographic keys, signatures, and encryption/decryption services necessary for identity and secure communication.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Defining mechanisms for proving identity and controlling access to resources or actions.

This crate is fundamental for establishing trust and security within the ICN.

## Public API Style

The API style emphasizes:

*   **Security:** Strong cryptographic practices and resistance to identity-related attacks.
*   **Interoperability:** Adherence to established standards for DIDs and VCs to ensure compatibility with other systems.
*   **Usability:** Clear interfaces for managing identities and credentials.
