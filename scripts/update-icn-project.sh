# Let's create core issues based on current repository state and protocol requirements

# 1. Economic Foundation
create_issue \
    "[EPIC] Economic Protocol Foundation" \
    "This epic tracks the implementation of the core economic features of the ICN protocol.

## Objectives
- Create `icn-economics` crate for mana and token systems
- Implement mana as a resource-based regenerative credit
- Implement token system with multiple classifications
- Ensure one-member-one-vote democratic governance
- Connect economic system with existing crates

## Current Status
- Basic infrastructure exists (identity, DAG, mesh)
- No economic implementation yet
- Need to ensure democratic principles are preserved

## Success Criteria
- Mana system operational with resource-based regeneration
- Token system with multiple classifications working
- Membership credentials grant voting rights (not token-based)
- Economic system integrates with existing components" \
    "epic,critical,milestone-1" \
    "M1: Foundation"

# 2. Mana System
create_issue \
    "[IMPL] Implement Mana System" \
    "Implement the mana system as described in protocol section 3.

## Requirements
- Create ManaLedger trait and implementations
- Add compute score calculation based on hardware resources
- Implement regeneration formula: R(t) = κ_org × σ × β × η × network_health_factor
- Set up organization weights (Cooperative = 1.00, Community = 0.95, etc.)
- Add emergency modulation capability

## Integration Points
- `icn-identity`: Connect with DIDs
- `icn-dag`: Store mana transactions
- `icn-node`: Pull hardware metrics for compute score

## Acceptance Criteria
- Mana regenerates based on actual compute resources
- Different organization types have appropriate weights
- Can spend mana for operations (DAG writes, etc.)
- Properly handles balance checks and edge cases" \
    "implementation,copilot-ready,milestone-1" \
    "M1: Foundation"

# 3. Token System
create_issue \
    "[IMPL] Implement Token System" \
    "Implement the token system as described in protocol section 4.

## Requirements
- Create TokenLedger trait and implementations
- Support token classifications:
  - Resource tokens (redeemable for compute)
  - Service tokens (specific service claims)
  - Labor tokens (human work representation)
  - Mutual credit (zero-interest credit lines)
  - Membership tokens (non-transferable)
- Implement token operations (create_class, mint, transfer, burn)
- Add anti-speculation mechanisms

## Critical Principles
- Membership tokens MUST be non-transferable
- Voting rights MUST derive from membership, not token holdings
- Token operations MUST require appropriate mana

## Acceptance Criteria
- All token classes properly implemented
- Transfer operations respect token rules
- Membership tokens cannot be transferred
- Anti-speculation mechanisms functional" \
    "implementation,copilot-ready,milestone-1" \
    "M1: Foundation"

# 4. Membership Credentials
create_issue \
    "[IMPL] Add Membership Credentials to Identity System" \
    "Extend the identity system to support non-transferable membership credentials.

## Context
The ICN protocol specifies that voting rights derive from membership, not wealth.

## Current Status
- Basic DID system exists in icn-identity
- Need to extend with membership credentials

## Requirements
- Add MembershipCredential type to credential system
- Implement MembershipGovernance trait
- Support membership application and voting
- Connect with governance system for voting rights

## Implementation Details
- Credentials must be non-transferable (soul-bound)
- Membership must be granted by democratic process
- Implement membership tiers (Applicant, Probationary, Full Member, Emeritus)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Membership credentials can be issued and verified
- Credentials confer voting rights in governance system
- Non-transferability is enforced
- Membership lifecycle works correctly" \
    "implementation,copilot-ready,milestone-1" \
    "M1: Foundation"

# 5. Economic Integration with Mesh
create_issue \
    "[IMPL] Integrate Economics with Mesh Job Marketplace" \
    "Add economic incentives to the mesh job marketplace as described in section 5.

## Requirements
- Add mana requirements for job submission and bidding
- Implement bid scoring algorithm with 5 factors:
  - compute_match (30%)
  - price_competitiveness (25%)
  - trust_score (20%)
  - locality_bonus (15%)
  - federation_affinity (10%)
- Implement economic feedback loops:
  - Success: Executor gets mana reward + trust increase
  - Failure: Executor gets mana slashed + trust decrease

## Current Status
- Basic mesh job system exists
- Need to add economic layer

## Acceptance Criteria
- Jobs require appropriate mana to submit
- Bid scoring includes all factors from protocol
- Economic incentives work correctly for success/failure
- Integration with trust system" \
    "implementation,copilot-ready,milestone-1" \
    "M1: Foundation"

# 6. Trust Scoring
create_issue \
    "[IMPL] Implement Trust Scoring System" \
    "Create the trust scoring system as described in section 2.3.

## Requirements
- Create TrustEngine trait and implementation
- Calculate trust multiplier (β) from multiple factors:
  - credential_weight
  - execution_history
  - governance_participation
  - federation_endorsements
- Ensure range is 0.5 ≤ β ≤ 2.0
- Implement trust accumulation rules

## Integration Points
- Connect with job execution history
- Connect with governance participation
- Connect with credential verification

## Acceptance Criteria
- Trust scores accurately reflect node behavior
- Successful job completions increase trust
- Governance participation increases trust
- Trust affects mana regeneration correctly" \

# 7. CCL Economic Contracts

## Requirements
- Implement TokenPolicy contract
- Implement ManaPolicy contract
- Add VotingRights contract
- Ensure democratic principles in governance

## Current Status
- CCL core exists but needs economic contracts

## Critical Principles
- Voting rights MUST be based on membership, not tokens/wealth
- Mana costs for governance actions must be waivable for members
- Economic policies must be democratically governable

## Acceptance Criteria
- All economic contracts compile and execute correctly
- Contracts enforce democratic principles
