# Implement Production Services by Default + Fix Critical Cryptographic Bug

## Production-by-Default Implementation

- Add `RuntimeContext::new()` and `new_async()` with production services by default
- Implement explicit testing constructors `new_for_testing()` to replace stub methods
- Add comprehensive service validation with actionable error messages
- Support feature flags for automatic service selection (libp2p, persistence backends)
- Maintain backward compatibility with deprecated method forwarding
- Add enhanced error messages guiding users to correct configurations

## ðŸ”’ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Identity/Signer Cryptographic Matching

### Bug Fixed
- `RuntimeContext::new_with_identity_and_storage()` and `new_async_with_identity_and_storage()` 
  were generating identity DIDs from one Ed25519 keypair and signers from a completely 
  different keypair, causing ALL signatures to fail verification

### Impact
- Any RuntimeContext created with `identity: None` was completely non-functional for:
  - Mesh job receipt signing/verification
  - Network message authentication  
  - Identity-based cryptographic operations
  - Any operation requiring signature verification

### Solution
- When `identity` parameter is `None`, both methods now generate identity DID and signer 
  from the SAME Ed25519 keypair, ensuring cryptographic consistency
- Added comprehensive test coverage verifying the fix works correctly
- Documented remaining edge case when explicit identity is provided without matching signer

### Files Changed
- `crates/icn-runtime/src/context/runtime_context.rs`: Core fix + production constructors
- `crates/icn-runtime/src/context/service_config.rs`: Enhanced configuration
- `crates/icn-runtime/src/lib.rs`: Updated test helpers
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Complete implementation summary
- `RUNTIME_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`: Migration guide with crypto validation examples

### Validation
- âœ… Cryptographic test suite confirms proper identity/signer matching
- âœ… Production service validation with comprehensive error messages
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained for existing code
- âœ… Feature flag integration working correctly
- âœ… Migration examples compile and function correctly
